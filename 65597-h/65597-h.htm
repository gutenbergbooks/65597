<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>TO
THE READER.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Pause</span> one moment, gentle
Reader&mdash;only one little moment will I detain you, while I
reply to the question which I have supposed you to ask in the
title-page.&nbsp; Blame not me, I beseech you, if you are
compelled to make the usual accusation against authors, that
there is nothing new in the pages which I diffidently present to
you: I am sorry for it, but I cannot help it.&nbsp; Solomon
asserted that all things under the sun were aged in his time; and
if the wisest of old gentlemen could find nothing new in that
early stage of his empire, what can be expected from a poor
scribbler like me, near three thousand <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>years
after him?&nbsp; Consider too, dear Reader, that this is the
first time I have appeared before you in the character of a
story-teller; and that I am a timid, nervous subject, and very
easily discouraged.&nbsp; Accept me then upon the score of
wishing to amuse you, and permit me to say something for my
Tales, after having said so much for myself.</p>
<p>Of the stories, &ldquo;Der Freisch&uuml;tz,&rdquo; as every
body knows, is from the German.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Fortunes of De
la Pole&rdquo; is original; so is &ldquo;The Prediction,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Yellow Dwarf,&rdquo; if I may be allowed that
claim for such a &ldquo;thing of shreds and patches;&rdquo; it is
an <i>olla podrida</i> of odds and ends, a snip of the garment of
every fairy tale written since the days of King Arthur.&nbsp; The
last story, &ldquo;The Lord of the Maelstrom,&rdquo; is also
original, though, as in that of &ldquo;The Yellow Dwarf,&rdquo; I
have raised my structure upon an old nursery foundation; but it
appeared to me an excellent vehicle for the beautiful mythology
<a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>of the
North, and the introduction of Odin and his exploits,&mdash;whose
history, by the way, I believe, has been extracted from the
Talmud, or from the rabbinical traditions of the events previous
to the creation, and the deeds of Moses and others.&nbsp; I,
moreover, designed to have given thee a little poetry for thy
money, gentle Reader, but the booksellers shook their heads when
I mentioned my design, and told me it was out of fashion; so I
returned my treasures in that way to my desk, there to remain,
among many other excellent things, I assure thee, until it should
again be the taste in England; and, in the meantime, offer these
Tales of <i>diablerie</i> for your amusement.&nbsp; Entreat me
kindly, gentle Reader, I beseech you, for two
reasons;&mdash;first, because it will entirely depend, upon your
reception of this, whether I shall ever write a second
volume&mdash;and secondly, because there has been a sad sweep
lately among those who used to cater for your diversion: many who
<a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>were most
deserving have been snatched from your admiration and
regard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shelley is not&mdash;Lord Byron is
not&mdash;and Maturin have they taken away.&rdquo;&nbsp; For
myself, I am not a long-lived man, and therefore advise you to
make much of me while I am with you; and as an example, look upon
these &ldquo;<i>coglionerie</i>&rdquo; with a milder eye than
their merits may seem to deserve from your judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I am, dear Reader, truly yours,</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE
PREDICTION.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk
of Graves.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the south-west coast of the
principality of Wales stands a romantic little village, inhabited
chiefly by the poorer class of people, consisting of small
farmers and oyster dredgers, whose estates are the wide ocean,
and whose ploughs are the small craft, in which they glide over
its interminable fields in search of the treasures which they
wring from its bosom; it is built on the very top of a hill,
commanding on the one side, a view of an immense bay, and on the
other, of the peaceful green fields and valleys, cultivated by <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>the greater
number of its quiet inhabitants.&nbsp; The approach to it from
the nearest town was by a road which branched away into lanes and
wooded walks, and from the sea by a beautiful little bay, running
up far into the land; both sides of which, and indeed all the
rest of the coast, were guarded by craggy and gigantic rocks,
some of them hollowed into caverns, into which none of the
inhabitants, from motives of superstition, reverence, and fear,
had ever dared to penetrate.&nbsp; There were, at the period of
which we are about to treat, no better sort of inhabitants in the
little village just described, none of those so emphatically
distinguished as &ldquo;quality&rdquo; by the country people;
they had neither parson, lawyer, nor doctor, among them, and of
course there was a tolerable equality among the residents.&nbsp;
The farmer, who followed his own plough in the spring, singing
the sweet wild national chaunt of the season, and bound up with
his own hands his sheaves in the autumn, was not richer, greater,
nor finer, than he who, bare-legged on the strand, gathered in
the hoar weed for the farmer in the spring, or dared the wild
winds of autumn and the wrath of the winter in his little boat,
to earn with his dredging net a yet harder subsistence for his
family.&nbsp; Distinctions were unknown in the village, every man
was the equal of his neighbour.</p>
<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>But,
though rank and its polished distinctions were strange in the
village of N&mdash;, the superiority of talent was felt and
acknowledged almost without a pause or a murmur.&nbsp; There was
one who was as a king amongst them, by the mere force of a
mightier spirit than those with whom he sojourned had been
accustomed to feel among them: he was a dark and moody man, a
stranger, evidently of a higher order than those around him, who
had but a few months before, without any apparent object, settled
among them: he was poor, but had no occupation&mdash;he lived
frugally, but quite alone&mdash;and his sole employments were to
read during the day, and wander out unaccompanied into the fields
or by the beach during the night.&nbsp; Sometimes indeed he would
relieve a suffering child or rheumatic old man by medicinal
herbs, reprove idleness and drunkenness in the youth, and predict
to all the good and evil consequences of their conduct; and his
success in some cases, his foresight in others, and his wisdom in
all, won for him a high reputation among the cottagers, to which
his taciturn habits contributed not a little, for, with the
vulgar as with the educated, no talker was ever seriously taken
for a conjuror, though a silent man is often decided to be a wise
one.</p>
<p>There was but one person in N&mdash; at all disposed <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>to rebel
against the despotic sovereignty which Rhys Meredith was silently
establishing over the quiet village, and that was precisely the
person most likely to effect a revolution; she was a beautiful
maiden, the glory and boast of the village, who had been the
favourite of, and to a certain degree educated by, the late lady
of the lord of the manor; but she had died, and her pupil, with a
full consciousness of her intellectual superiority, had returned
to her native village, where she determined to have an empire of
her own, which no rival should dispute: she laughed at the
maidens who listened to the predictions of Rhys, and she refused
her smiles to the youths who consulted him upon their affairs and
their prospects; and as the beautiful Ruth was generally beloved,
the silent Rhys was soon in danger of being abandoned by all,
save doting men and paralytic women, and feeling himself an
outcast in the village of N&mdash;.</p>
<p>But to be such was not the object of Meredith; he was an idle
man, and the gifts of the villagers contributed to spare him from
exertion; he knew too, that in another point of view this
ascendancy was necessary to his purposes; and as he had failed to
establish it by wisdom and benevolence, he determined to try the
effect of fear.&nbsp; The character of the people with whom he
sojourned was <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>admirably calculated to assist his projects; his
predictions were now uttered more clearly, and his threats
denounced in sterner tones and stronger and plainer words; and
when he predicted that old Morgan Williams, who had been stricken
with the palsy, would die at the turn of tide, three days from
that on which he spoke, and that the light little boat of gay
Griffy Morris, which sailed from the bay in a bright
winter&rsquo;s morning, should never again make the shore; and
the man died, and the storm arose, even as he had said;
men&rsquo;s hearts died within them, and they bowed down before
his words, as if he had been their general fate and the
individual destiny of each.</p>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s rosy lip grew pale for a moment as she heard of
these things; in the next her spirit returned, and &ldquo;I will
make him tell my fortune,&rdquo; she said, as she went with a
party of laughers to search out and deride the conjuror.&nbsp; He
was alone when they broke in upon him, and their mockeries goaded
his spirit; but his anger was deep, not loud; and while burning
with wrath, he yet could calmly consider the means of vengeance:
he knew the master spirit with which he had to contend; it was no
ordinary mind, and would have smiled at ordinary terrors.&nbsp;
To have threatened her with sickness, misfortune, or death, <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>would have been
to call forth the energies of that lofty spirit, and prepare it
to endure, and it would have gloried in manifesting its powers of
endurance; he must humble it therefore by debasement; he must
ruin its confidence in itself; and to this end he resolved to
threaten her with crime.&nbsp; His resolution was taken and
effected; his credit was at stake; he must daunt his enemy, or
surrender to her power: he foretold sorrows and joys to the
listening throng, not according to his passion, but his judgment,
and he drew a blush upon the cheek of one, by revealing a secret
which Ruth herself, and another, alone knew, and which prepared
the former to doubt of her own judgment, as it related to this
extraordinary man.</p>
<p>Ruth was the last who approached to hear the secret of her
destiny.&nbsp; The wizard paused as he looked upon
her,&mdash;opened his book,&mdash;shut
it,&mdash;paused,&mdash;and again looked sadly and fearfully upon
her; she tried to smile, but felt startled, she knew not why; the
bright inquiring glance of her dark eye could not change the
purpose of her enemy.&nbsp; Her smile could not melt, nor even
temper, the hardness of his deep-seated malice: he again looked
sternly upon her brow, and then coldly wrung out the slow
soul-withering words, &ldquo;Maiden, thou art doomed to be a
murderer!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>From that
hour Rhys Meredith became the destiny of Ruth Tudor.&nbsp; At
first she spurned at his prediction, and alternately cursed and
laughed at him for the malice of his falsehood: but when she
found that none laughed with her, that men looked upon her with
suspicious eyes, women shrunk from her society, and children
shrieked at her presence, she felt that these were signs of
truth, and her high spirit no longer struggled against the
conviction; a change came over her mind when she had known how
horrid it was to be alone.&nbsp; Abhorring the prophet, she yet
clung to his footsteps, and while she sat by his side, felt as if
he alone could avert that evil destiny which he alone had
foreseen.&nbsp; With him only was she seen to smile; elsewhere,
sad, silent, stern; it seemed as if she were ever occupied in
nerving her mind for that which she had to do, and her beauty,
already of the majestic cast, grew absolutely awful, as her
perfect features assumed an expression which might have belonged
to the angel of vengeance or death.</p>
<p>But there were moments when her naturally strong spirit, not
yet wholly subdued, struggled against her conviction, and
endeavoured to find modes of averting her fate: it was in one of
these, perhaps, that she gave her hand to a wooer, from a distant
part of the country, a sailor, who either <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>had not heard,
or did not regard the prediction of Rhys, upon condition that he
should remove her far from her native village to the home of his
family and friends, for she sometimes felt as if the decree which
had gone forth against her, could not be fulfilled except upon
the spot where she had heard it, and that her heart would be
lighter if men&rsquo;s eyes would again look upon her in
kindliness, and she no longer sate beneath the glare of those
that knew so well the secret of her soul.&nbsp; Thus thinking,
she quitted N&mdash; with her husband; and the tormentor, who had
poisoned her repose, soon after her departure, left the village
as secretly and as suddenly as he had entered it.</p>
<p>But, though Ruth could depart from his corporeal presence, and
look upon his cruel visage no more, yet the eye of her soul was
fixed upon his shadow, and his airy form, the creation of her
sorrow, still sat by her side; the blight that he had breathed
upon her peace had withered her heart, and it was in vain that
she sought to forget or banish the recollection from her
brain.&nbsp; Men and women smiled upon her as before in the days
of her joy, the friends of her husband welcomed her to their
bosoms, but they could give no peace to her heart: she shrunk
from their friendship, she shivered equally at their neglect, she
dreaded any cause that might lead to that which, it had <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>been said, she
must do; nightly she sat alone and thought, she dwelt upon the
characters of those around her, and shuddered that in some she
saw violence and selfishness enough to cause injury, which she
might be supposed to resent to blood.&nbsp; Then she wept bitter
tears and thought of her native village, whose inhabitants were
so mild, and whose previous knowledge of her hapless destiny
might induce them to avoid all that might hasten its completion,
and sighed to think she had ever left it in the mistaken hope of
finding peace elsewhere.&nbsp; Again, her sick fancy would ponder
upon the modes of murder, and wonder how her victim would
fall.&nbsp; Against the use of actual violence she had disabled
herself; she had never struck a blow, her small hand would have
suffered injury in the attempt; she understood not the usage of
fire-arms, she was ignorant of what were poisons, and a knife she
never allowed herself, even for the most necessary purposes: how
then could she slay?&nbsp; At times she took comfort from
thoughts like these, and at others, in the blackness of her
despair, she would cry, &ldquo;If it must be, O let it come, and
these miserable anticipations cease; then I shall, at least,
destroy but one; now, in my incertitude, I am the murderer of
many!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Her
husband went forth and returned upon the voyages which made up
the avocation and felicity of his life, without noticing the
deep-rooted sorrow of his wife; he was a common man, and of a
common mind; his eye had not seen the awful beauty of her whom he
had chosen; his spirit had not felt her power; and, if he had
marked, he would not have understood her grief; so she ministered
to him as a duty.&nbsp; She was a silent and obedient wife, but
she saw him come home without joy, and witnessed his departure
without regret; he neither added to nor diminished her sorrow:
but destiny had one solitary blessing in store for the victim of
its decrees,&mdash;a child was born to the hapless Ruth, a lovely
little girl soon slept upon her bosom, and, coming as it did, the
one lone and lovely rose-bud in her desolate garden, she welcomed
it with a warmer joy and cherished it with a kindlier hope.</p>
<p>A few years went by unsoiled by the wretchedness which had
marked the preceding; the joy of the mother softened the anguish
of the condemned, and sometimes when she looked upon her daughter
she ceased to despair: but destiny had not forgotten her claim,
and soon her hand pressed heavily upon her victim; the giant
ocean rolled over the body of her husband, poverty <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>visited the
cottage of the widow, and famine&rsquo;s gaunt figure was visible
in the distance.&nbsp; Oppression came with these, for arrears of
rent were demanded, and he who asked was brutal in his anger and
harsh in his language to the sufferers.&nbsp; Ruth shuddered as
she heard him speak, and trembled for him and for herself; the
unforgotten prophecy arose in her mind, and she preferred even
witnesses to his brutality and her degradation, rather than
encounter his anger and her own dark thoughts alone.</p>
<p>Thus goaded, she saw but one thing that could save her, she
fled from her persecutors to the home of her youth, and, leading
her little Rachel by the hand, threw herself into the arms of her
kin: they received her with distant kindness, and assured her
that she should not want: in this they kept their promise, but it
was all they did for Ruth and her daughter; a miserable
subsistence was given to them, and that was embittered by
distrust, and the knowledge that it was yielded unwillingly.</p>
<p>Among the villagers, although she was no longer shunned as
formerly, her story was not forgotten; if it had been, her
terrific beauty, the awful flashing of her eyes, her large black
curls hanging like thunder-clouds over her stern and <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>stately brow
and marble throat, her majestic stature, and solemn movements,
would have recalled it to their recollections.&nbsp; She was a
marked being, and all believed (though each would have pitied
her, had they not been afraid) that her evil destiny was not to
be averted; she looked like one fated to some wonderful
deed.&nbsp; They saw she was not of them, and though they did not
directly avoid her, yet they never threw themselves in her way,
and thus the hapless Ruth had ample leisure to contemplate and
grieve over her fate.&nbsp; One night she sat alone in her
wretched hovel, and, with many bitter ruminations, was watching
the happy sleep of her child, who slumbered tranquilly on their
only bed: midnight had long passed, yet Ruth was not disposed to
rest; she trimmed her dull light, and said mentally, &ldquo;Were
I not poor, such a temptation might not assail me, riches would
procure me deference; but poverty, or the wrongs it brings, may
drive me to this evil; were I above want it would be less likely
to be.&nbsp; O, my child, for thy sake would I avoid this doom
more than for mine own, for if it should bring death to me, what
will it not hurl on thee?&mdash;infamy, agony, scorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wept aloud as she spoke, and scarcely seemed to notice the
singularity (at that late <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>hour) of some one without, attempting
to open the door; she heard, but the circumstance made little
impression; she knew that as yet her doom was unfulfilled, and
that, therefore, no danger could reach her; she was no coward at
any time, but now despair had made her brave; the door opened and
a stranger entered, without either alarming or disturbing her,
and it was not till he had stood face to face with Ruth, and
discovered his features to be those of Rhys Meredith, that she
sprung up from her seat and gazed wildly and earnestly upon
him.</p>
<p>Meredith gave her no time to question; &ldquo;Ruth
Tudor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;behold the cruelest of thy foes
comes sueing to thy pity and mercy; I have embittered thy
existence, and doomed thee to a terrible lot; what first was
dictated by vengeance and malice became truth as I uttered it,
for what I spoke I believed.&nbsp; Yet, take comfort, some of my
predictions have failed, and why may not this be false?&nbsp; In
my own fate I have ever been deceived, perhaps I may be equally
so in thine; in the mean time have pity upon him who was thy
enemy, but who, when his vengeance was uttered, instantly became
thy friend.&nbsp; I was poor, and thy scorn might have robbed me
of subsistence in danger, and thy contempt might have <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>given me
up.&nbsp; Beggared by many disastrous events, hunted by
creditors, I fled from my wife and son because I could no longer
bear to contemplate their suffering; I sought fortune all ways
since we parted, and always has she eluded my grasp till last
night, when she rather tempted than smiled upon me.&nbsp; At an
idle fair I met the steward of this estate drunk and stupid, but
loaded with gold; he travelled towards home alone; I could not,
did not wrestle with the fiend that possessed me, but hastened to
overtake him in his lonely ride.&mdash;Start not! no hair of his
head was harmed by me; of his gold I robbed him, but not of his
life, though, had I been the greater villain, I should now be in
less danger, since he saw and marked my person: three hundred
pounds is the meed of my daring, and I must keep it now or
die.&nbsp; Ruth, thou too art poor and forsaken, but thou art
faithful and kind, and wilt not betray me to justice; save me,
and I will not enjoy my riches alone; thou knowest all the caves
in the rocks, those hideous hiding places, where no foot, save
thine, has dared to tread; conceal me in these till the pursuit
be past, and I will give thee one half my wealth, and return with
the other to gladden my wife and son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hand of Ruth was already opened, and <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>in
imagination she grasped the wealth he promised; oppression and
poverty had somewhat clouded the nobleness, but not the
fierceness of her spirit.&nbsp; She saw that riches would save
her from wrath, perhaps from blood, and, as the means to escape
so mighty an evil, she was not scrupulous respecting a lesser:
independently of this, she felt a great interest in the safety of
Rhys; her own fate seemed to hang upon his; she hid the ruffian
in the caves and supplied him with light and food.</p>
<p>There was a happiness now in the heart of Ruth&mdash;a joy in
her thoughts as she sat all the long day upon the deserted settle
of her wretched fire-side, to which they had for many years been
strangers.&nbsp; Many times during the past years of her sorrow
she hath thought of Rhys, and longed to look upon his face and
sit beneath his shadow, as one whose presence could preserve her
from the evil fate which he himself had predicted.&nbsp; She had
long since forgiven him his prophecy; she believed he had spoken
truth, and this gave her a wild confidence in his power; a
confidence that sometimes thought, &ldquo;if he can foreknow, can
he not also avert?&rdquo;&nbsp; She said mentally, without any
reference to the temporal good he had promised her, &ldquo;I have
a treasure in <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>those caves; <i>he</i> is there; he who hath foreseen
and may oppose my destiny; he hath shadowed my days with sorrow,
and forbidden me, like ordinary beings, to hope: yet he is now in
my power; his life is in my hands; he says so, yet I believe him
not, for I cannot betray him if I would; were I to lead the
officers of justice to the spot where he lies crouching, he would
be invisible to their sight or to mine; or I should become
speechless ere I could say, &lsquo;Behold him.&rsquo;&nbsp; No,
he cannot die by me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she thought she would deserve his confidence, and support
him in his suffering; she had concealed him in a deep dark cave,
hewn far in the rock, to which she alone knew the entrance from
the beach; there was another (if a huge aperture in the top of
the rock might be so called), which, far from attempting to
descend, the peasants and seekers for the culprit had scarcely
dared to look into, so perpendicular, dark, and uncertain was the
hideous descent into what justly appeared to them a bottomless
abyss; they passed over his head in their search through the
fields above, and before the mouth of his den upon the beach
below, yet they left him in safety, though in incertitude and
fear.</p>
<p>It was less wonderful, the suspicionless conduct <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>of the
villagers towards Ruth, than the calm prudence with which she
conducted all the details relating to her secret; her poverty was
well known, yet she daily procured a double portion of food,
which was won by double labour; she toiled in the fields for the
meed of oaten cake and potatoes, or she dashed out in a crazy
boat on the wide ocean to win with the dredgers the spoils of the
oyster beds that lie on its bosom; the daintier fare was for the
unhappy guest, and daily did she wander among the rocks, when the
tides were retiring, for the shell-fish which they had flung
among the fissures in their retreat, which she bore, exhausted
with fatigue, to her home&mdash;and which her lovely child, now
rising into womanhood, prepared for the luxurious meal; it was
wonderful too, the settled prudence of the little maiden, who
spoke nothing of the food which was borne from their frugal
board; if she suspected the secret of her mother, she respected
it too much to allow others to discover that she did so.</p>
<p>Many sad hours did Ruth pass in the robber&rsquo;s cave; and
many times, by conversing with him upon the subject of her
destiny, did she seek to alleviate the pangs its recollection
gave her; but the result of such discussions were by no means
favourable to her hopes; Rhys had acknowledged <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>that his
threat had originated in malice, and that he intended to alarm
and subdue, but not to the extent that he had effected: &ldquo;I
knew well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that disgrace alone would
operate upon you as I wished, for I foresaw you would glory in
the thought of nobly sustained misfortune; I meant to degrade you
with the lowest; I meant to attribute to you what I now painfully
experience to be the vilest of the vices; I intended to tell you,
you were destined to be a thief, but I could not utter the words
I had arranged, and I was struck with horror at those I heard
involuntarily proceeding from my lips; I would have recalled them
but I could not; I would have said, &lsquo;Maiden, I did but
jest,&rsquo; but there was something that seemed to withhold my
speech and press upon my soul, &lsquo;so as thou hast said shall
this thing be&rsquo;&mdash;yet take comfort, my own fortunes have
ever deceived me, and doubtlessly ever will, for I feel as if I
should one day return to this cave and make it my final
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke solemnly and wept,&mdash;but the awful eye of his
companion was unmoved as she looked on in wonder and contempt at
his grief.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou knowest not how to endure,&rdquo;
said she to him, &ldquo;and as soon as night shall again fall
upon our mountains, I will lead thee forth on thy escape; <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>the danger of
pursuit is now past; at midnight be ready for thy journey, leave
the cave, and ascend the rocks by the path I shewed thee, to the
field in which its mouth is situated; wait me there a few
moments, and I will bring thee a fleet horse, ready saddled for
the journey, for which thy gold must pay, since I must declare to
the owner that I have sold it at a distance, and for more than
its rated value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That midnight came, and Meredith waited with trembling anxiety
for the haughty step of Ruth; at length he saw her, she had
ascended the rock, and, standing on its verge, was looking around
for her guest; as she was thus alone in the clear moonlight,
standing between rock and sky, and scarcely seeming to touch the
earth, her dark locks and loose garments scattered by the wind,
she looked like some giant spirit of the older time, preparing to
ascend into the mighty black cloud which singly hung from the
empyreum, and upon which she already appeared to recline;
Meredith beheld her and shuddered,&mdash;but she approached and
he recovered his recollection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be speedy in your movements,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;when you leave me; your horse waits on the other side of
this field, and I would have <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>you hasten lest his neighings should
betray your purpose.&nbsp; But, before you depart, Rhys Meredith,
there is an account to be settled between us: I have dared danger
and privations for you; that the temptations of the poor may not
assail me, give me my reward and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhys pressed his leathern bag to his bosom, but answered
nothing to the speech of Ruth: he seemed to be studying some
evasion, for he looked upon the ground, and there was trouble in
the working of his lip.&nbsp; At length he said cautiously,
&ldquo;I have it not with me; I buried it, lest it should betray
me, in a field some miles distant; thither will I go, dig it up,
and send it to thee from B&mdash;, which is, as thou knowest, my
first destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth gave him one glance of her awful eye when he had spoken;
she had detected his meanness, and smiled at his incapacity to
deceive.&nbsp; &ldquo;What dost thou press to thy bosom so
earnestly?&rdquo; she demanded; &ldquo;surely thou art not the
wise man I deemed thee, thus to defraud <i>my</i> claim: thy
friend alone thou mightest cheat, and safely; but I have been
made wretched by thee, guilty by thee, and thy life is in my
power; I could, as thou knowest; easily raise the village, and
win half thy wealth by giving thee up to justice; but <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>I prefer
reward from thy wisdom and gratitude; give, therefore, and be
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Rhys knew too well the value of the metal of sin to yield
one half of it to Ruth; he tried many miserable shifts and lies,
and at last, baffled by the calm penetration of his antagonist,
boldly avowed his intention of keeping all the spoil he had won
with so much hazard.&nbsp; Ruth looked at him with scorn:
&ldquo;Keep thy gold,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;if it thus can
harden hearts, I covet not its possession; but there is one thing
thou must do, and that ere thou stir one foot.&nbsp; I have
supported thee with hard earned industry, <i>that</i> I give
thee; more proud, it should seem, in bestowing than I could be,
from such as thee, in receiving: but the horse that is to bear
thee hence to-night I borrowed for a distant journey; I must
return with it, or with its value; open thy bag, pay me for that,
and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Rhys seemed afraid to open his bag in the presence of her
he had wronged.&nbsp; Ruth understood his fears; but, scorning
vindication of <i>her</i> principles, contented herself with
entreating him to be honest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be more just to thyself
and me,&rdquo; she persisted: &ldquo;the debt of gratitude I
pardon thee; but, I beseech thee, leave me not to encounter the
consequence of having stolen from my <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>friend the animal which is his only
means of subsistence: I pray thee, Rhys, not to condemn me to
scorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was to no avail that Ruth humbled herself to entreaties;
Meredith answered not, and while she was yet speaking, cast
side-long looks towards the gate where the horse was waiting for
his service, and seemed meditating, whether he should not dart
from Ruth, and escape her entreaties and demands by dint of
speed.&nbsp; Her stern eye detected his purpose; and, indignant
at his baseness, and ashamed of her own degradation, she sprung
suddenly towards him, made a desperate clutch at the leathern
bag, and tore it from the grasp of the deceiver.&nbsp; Meredith
made an attempt to recover it, and a fierce struggle ensued,
which drove them both back towards the yawning mouth of the cave
from which he had just ascended to the world.&nbsp; On its very
verge, on its very extreme edge, the demon who had so long ruled
his spirit now instigated him to mischief, and abandoned him to
his natural brutality: he struck the unhappy Ruth a revengeful
and tremendous blow.&nbsp; At that moment a horrible thought
glanced like lightning through her soul; he was to her no longer
what he had been; he was a robber, ruffian, liar; one whom to
destroy was justice, and <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>perhaps it was he&mdash;.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;thou&mdash;thou didst
predict that I was doomed to be a murderer! art thou&mdash;art
thou destined to be the victim?&rdquo;&nbsp; She flung him from
her with terrific force, as he stood close to the abyss, and the
next instant heard him dash against its sides, as he was whirled
headlong into the darkness.</p>
<p>It was an awful feeling, the next that passed over the soul of
Ruth Tudor, as she stood alone in the pale sorrowful-looking
moonlight, endeavouring to remember what had chanced.&nbsp; She
gazed on the purse, on the chasm, wiped the drops of agony from
her heated brow, and then, with a sudden pang of recollection,
rushed down to the cavern.&nbsp; The light was still burning, as
Rhys had left it, and served to shew her the wretch extended
helplessly beneath the chasm.&nbsp; Though his body was crushed,
his bones splintered, and his blood was on the cavern&rsquo;s
sides, he was yet living, and raised his head to look upon her,
as she darkened the narrow entrance in her passage: he glared
upon her with the visage of a demon, and spoke like a fiend in
pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me hast thou murdered!&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but I shall be avenged in all thy life to come.&nbsp; Deem
not that thy doom is fulfilled, that the deed to which thou art
fated is done: in my dying hour I know, I <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>feel what is
to come upon thee; thou art yet again to do a deed of
blood!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; shrieked the infuriated
victim.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art yet doomed to be a
murderer!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Liar!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou
art&mdash;and of&mdash;thine only child!&rdquo;&nbsp; She rushed
to him, but he was dead.</p>
<p>Ruth Tudor stood for a moment by the corpse blind, stupefied,
deaf, and dumb; in the next she laughed aloud, till the cavern
rung with her ghastly mirth, and many voices mingled with and
answered it; but the noises scared and displeased her, and in an
instant she became stupidly grave; she threw back her dark locks
with an air of offended dignity, and walked forth majestically
from the cave.&nbsp; She took the horse by his rein, and led him
back to his stable: with the same unvarying calmness she entered
her cottage, and listened to the quiet breathings of her sleeping
child; she longed to approach her nearer, but some new and horrid
fear restrained her, and held back her anxious step: suddenly
remembrance and reason returned, and she uttered a shriek so full
of agony, so loud and shrill, that her daughter sprung from her
bed, and threw herself into her arms.</p>
<p>It was in vain that the gentle Rachel supplicated her mother
to find rest in sleep.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>here,&rdquo;
she muttered, &ldquo;it must not be here; the deep cave and the
hard rock, these shall be my resting place; and the bedfellow,
lo! now, he waits my coming.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she would cry
aloud, clasp her Rachel to her beating heart, and as suddenly, in
horror thrust her from it.</p>
<p>The next midnight beheld Ruth Tudor in the cave, seated upon a
point of rock, at the head of the corpse, her chin resting upon
her hands, gazing earnestly upon the distorted face.&nbsp; Decay
had already begun its work; and Ruth sat there watching the
progress of mortality, as if she intended that her stern eye
should quicken and facilitate its operation.&nbsp; The next night
also beheld her there, but the current of her thoughts had
changed, and the dismal interval which had passed appeared to be
forgotten.&nbsp; She stood with her basket of food: &ldquo;Wilt
thou not eat?&rdquo; she demanded; &ldquo;arise, strengthen thee
for thy journey; eat, eat, thou sleeper; wilt thou never awaken?
look, here is the meat thou lovest;&rdquo; and as she raised his
head, and put the food to his lips, the frail remnant of
mortality shattered at her touch, and again she knew that he was
dead.</p>
<p>It was evident to all that a shadow and a change was over the
senses of Ruth; till this period she had been only wretched, but
now <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>madness was mingled with her grief.&nbsp; It was in no
instance more apparent than in her conduct towards her beloved
child: indulgent to all her wishes, ministering to all her wants
with a liberal hand, till men wondered from whence she derived
the means of indulgence, she yet seized every opportunity to send
her from her presence.&nbsp; The gentle-hearted Rachel wept at
her conduct, yet did not complain, for she believed it the effect
of the disease, that had for so many years been preying upon her
soul.&nbsp; Her nights were passed in roaming abroad, her days in
the solitude of her hut; and even this became painful, when the
step of her child broke upon it.&nbsp; At length she signified
that a relative of her husband had died and left her wealth, and
that it should enable her to dispose of herself as she had long
wished; so leaving Rachel with her relatives in N&mdash;, she
retired to a hut upon a lonely heath, where she was less
wretched, because abandoned to her wretchedness.</p>
<p>In many of her ravings she had frequently spoken darkly of her
crime, and her nightly visits to the cave; and more frequently
still she addressed some unseen thing, which she asserted was for
ever at her side.&nbsp; But few heard these horrors, and those
who did, called to mind the <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>early prophecy, and deemed them the
workings of insanity in a fierce and imaginative mind.&nbsp; So
thought also the beloved Rachel, who hastened daily to embrace
her mother, but not now alone as formerly; a youth of the village
was her companion and protector, one who had offered her worth
and love, and whose gentle offers were not rejected.&nbsp; Ruth,
with a hurried gladness, gave her consent, and a blessing to her
child; and it was remarked that she received her daughter more
kindly, and detained her longer at the cottage, when Evan was by
her side, than when she went to the gloomy heath alone.&nbsp;
Rachel herself soon made this observation, and as she could
depend upon the honesty and prudence of him she loved, she felt
less fear at his being a frequent witness of her mother&rsquo;s
terrific ravings.&nbsp; Thus all that human consolation was
capable to afford was offered to the sufferer by her sympathising
children.</p>
<p>But the delirium of Ruth Tudor appeared to increase with every
nightly visit to the cave of secret blood; some hideous shadow
seemed to follow her steps in the darkness, and sit by her side
in the light.&nbsp; Sometimes she held strange parley with this
creation of her phrensy, and at others smiled upon it in scornful
silence; now, her language was in the tones of entreaty, pity,
and forgiveness; anon, it was the burst of execration, <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>curses, and
scorn.&nbsp; To the gentle listeners her words were blasphemy;
and, shuddering at her boldness, they deemed, in the simple
holiness of their own hearts, that the evil one was besetting
her, and that religion alone could banish him.&nbsp; Possessed by
this idea, Evan one day suddenly interrupted her tremendous
denunciations upon her fate, and him who, she said, stood over
her to fulfil it, with imploring her to open the book which he
held in his hand, and seek consolation from its words and its
promises.&nbsp; She listened, and grew calm in a moment; with an
awful smile she bade him open, and read at the first place which
should meet his eye: &ldquo;from that, the word of truth, as thou
sayest, I shall know my fate; what is there written I will
believe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He opened the book, and read&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Whither shall I go from thy spirit</i>, <i>or
whither shall I flee from thy presence</i>?&nbsp; <i>If I go up
into heaven</i>, <i>thou art there</i>; <i>if I make my bed in
hell</i>, <i>thou art there</i>; <i>If I take the wings of the
morning</i>, <i>and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea</i>,
<i>even there shall thy hand lead me</i>, <i>and thy right hand
shall hold me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth laid her hand upon the book: &ldquo;it is enough; its
words are truth; it hath said there is no hope, and I find
comfort in my <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>despair: I have already spoken thus in the secrecy of my
heart, and I know that he will be obeyed; the unnamed sin must
be&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Evan knew not how to comfort, so he shut
up his book and retired; and Rachel kissed the cheek of her
mother, as she bade her a tender good night.&nbsp; Another month
and she was to be the bride of Evan, and she passed over the
heath with a light step, for the thought of her bridal seemed to
give joy to her mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall all be happy
then,&rdquo; said the smiling girl, as the youth of her heart
parted from her hand for the night; &ldquo;and heaven kindly
grant that happiness may last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time appointed for the marriage of Rachel Tudor and Evan
Edwards had long passed away, and winter had set in with unusual
sternness even on that stormy coast; when, during a land tempest,
on a dark November afternoon, a stranger to the country,
journeying on foot, lost his way in endeavouring to find a short
route to his destination, over stubble fields and meadow lands,
by following the footmarks of those who had preceded him.&nbsp;
The stranger was a young man, of a bright eye and a hardy look,
and he went on buffeting the elements, and buffeted by them,
without a thought of weariness, or a single expression of
impatience.&nbsp; Night descended upon <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>him as he walked, and the snow storm
came down with unusual violence, as if to try the temper of his
mind, a mind cultivated and enlightened, though cased in a frame
accustomed to hardships, and veiled by a plain, nay almost rustic
exterior.&nbsp; The thunder roared loudly above him, and the wind
blowing tremendously, raised the new-fallen snow from the earth,
which, mingling with the showers as they fell, raised a clatter
about his head which bewildered and blinded the traveller, who,
finding himself near some leafless brambles and a few clustered
bushes of the mountain broom, took shelter under them to recover
his senses, and reconnoitre his position.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of all
these ingredients for a storm,&rdquo; said he smilingly to
himself, &ldquo;the lightning is the most endurable after all;
for if it does not kill, it may at least cure, by lighting the
way out of a labyrinth, and by its bright flashes I hope to
discover where I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this hope he was not
mistaken: the brilliant and beautiful gleam shewed him, when the
snow shower had somewhat abated, every stunted bush and blade of
grass for some miles, and something, about the distance of one,
that looked like a white-washed cottage of some poor encloser of
the miserable heath upon which he was now standing.&nbsp; Full of
hope of a shelter from the <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>storm, and, lit onwards by the
magnificent torch of heaven, the stranger trod cheerily forwards,
and in less than half an hour, making full allowance for his
retrograding between the flashes, arrived at his beacon the white
cottage, which, from the low wall of loose limestones by which it
was surrounded, he judged to be, as he had already imagined, the
humble residence of some poor tenant of the manor.&nbsp; He
opened the little gate, and was proceeding to knock at the door,
when his steps were arrested by a singular and unexpected sound;
it was a choral burst of many voices, singing slowly and solemnly
that magnificent dirge of the church of England the 104th
psalm.&nbsp; The stranger loved music, and the sombrous melody of
that fine air had an instant effect upon his feelings; he
lingered in solemn and silent admiration till the majestic strain
had ceased; he then knocked gently at the door, which was
instantly and courteously opened to his inquiry.</p>
<p>On entering, he found himself in a cottage of a more
respectable interior than from its outward appearance he had been
led to expect: but he had little leisure or inclination for the
survey of its effects, for his senses and imagination were
immediately and entirely occupied by the scene <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>which
presented itself on his entrance.&nbsp; In the centre of the room
into which he had been so readily admitted, stood, on its
tressels, an open coffin; lights were at its head and foot, and
on each side sat many persons of both sexes, who appeared to be
engaged in the customary ceremony of watching the corse previous
to its interment in the morning.&nbsp; There were many who
appeared to the stranger to be watchers, but there were but two
who, in his eye, bore the appearance of mourners, and they had
faces of grief which spoke too plainly of the anguish that was
mingling within: one, at the foot of the coffin, was a pale youth
just blooming into manhood, who covered his dewy eyes with
trembling fingers that ill concealed the tears which trickled
down his wan cheeks beneath: the other&mdash;; but why should we
again describe that still unbowed and lofty form?&nbsp; The awful
marble brow upon which the stranger gazed, was that of Ruth
Tudor.</p>
<p>There was much whispering and quiet talk among the people
while refreshments were handed amongst them; and so little
curiosity was excited by the appearance of the traveller, that he
naturally concluded that it must be no common loss that could
deaden a feeling usually so intense in the bosoms of Welsh
peasants: he was even <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>checked for an attempt to question;
but one man,&mdash;he who had given him admittance, and seemed to
possess authority in the circle,&mdash;told him he would answer
his questions when the guests should depart, but till then he
must keep silence.&nbsp; The traveller endeavoured to obey, and
sat down in quiet contemplation of the figure who most interested
his attention, and who sat at the coffin&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Ruth
Tudor spoke nothing, nor did she appear to heed aught of the
business that was passing around her.&nbsp; Absorbed by
reflection, her eyes were generally cast to the ground; but when
they were raised, the traveller looked in vain for that
expression of grief which had struck him so forcibly on his
entrance; there was something wonderfully strange in the
character of her perfect features: could he have found words for
his thought, and might have been permitted the expression, he
would have called it triumphant despair; so deeply agonised, so
proudly stern; looked the mourner who sat by the dead.</p>
<p>The interest which the traveller took in the scene became more
intense the longer he gazed upon its action; unable to resist the
anxiety which had begun to prey upon his spirit, he arose and
walked towards the coffin, with the purpose of contemplating its
inhabitant: a sad explanation <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>was given, by its appearance, of the
grief and the anguish he had witnessed; a beautiful girl was
reposing in the narrow house, with a face as calm and lovely as
if she but slept a deep and refreshing sleep, and the morning sun
would again smile upon her awakening: salt, the emblem of the
immortal soul, was placed upon her breast; and, in her pale and
perishing fingers, a branch of living flowers were struggling for
life in the grasp of death, and diffusing their sweet and
gracious fragrance over the cold odour of mortality.&nbsp; These
images, so opposite, yet so alike, affected the spirit of the
gazer, and he almost wept as he continued looking upon them, till
he was aroused from his trance by the strange conduct of Ruth
Tudor, who had caught a glimpse of his face as he bent in sorrow
over the coffin.&nbsp; She sprung up from her seat, and darting
at him a terrible glance of recognition, pointed down to the
corse, and then, with a hollow burst of frantic laughter,
shouted&mdash;&ldquo;Behold, thou liar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The startled stranger was relieved from the necessity of
speaking by some one taking his arm and gently leading him to the
farther end of the cottage: the eyes of Ruth followed him, and it
was not till he had done violence to himself in turning from her
to his conductor, that he could <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>escape their singular
fascination.&nbsp; When he did so, he beheld a venerable man, the
pastor of a distant village, who had come that night to speak
comfort to the mourners, and perform the last sad duty to the
dead on the morrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be not alarmed at what you have
witnessed, my young friend,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;these ravings
are not uncommon: this unhappy woman, at an early period of her
life, gave ear to the miserable superstitions of her country, and
a wretched pretender to wisdom predicted that she should become a
shedder of blood: madness has been the inevitable consequence in
an ardent spirit, and in its ravings she dreams she has committed
one sin, and is still tempted to add to it another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may say what you please, parson,&rdquo; said the
old man who had given admittance to the stranger, and who now,
after dismissing all the guests save the youth, joined the
talkers, and seated himself on the settle by their side;
&ldquo;you may say what you please about madness and
superstition; but I know Ruth Tudor was a fated woman, and the
deed that was to be I believe she has done: ay, ay, her madness
is conscience; and if the deep sea and the jagged rocks could
speak, they might tell us a tale of other things than that: but
she is judged now; her only child <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>is gone&mdash;her pretty
Rachel.&nbsp; Poor Evan! he was her suitor: ah, he little thought
two months ago, when he was preparing for a gay bridal, that her
slight sickness would end thus: <i>he</i> does not deserve it;
but for her&mdash;God forgive me if I do her wrong, but I think
it is the hand of God, and it lies heavy, as it
should.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the grey-haired old man hobbled away,
satisfied that in thus thinking he was shewing his zeal for
virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, that so white a head should acknowledge so hard a
heart!&rdquo; said the pastor; &ldquo;Ruth is condemned,
according to his system, for committing that which a mightier
hand compelled her to do; how harsh and misjudging is age!&nbsp;
But we must not speak so loud,&rdquo; continued he; &ldquo;for
see, the youth Evan is retiring for the night, and the miserable
mother has thrown herself on the floor to sleep; the sole
domestic is rocking on her stool, and therefore I will do the
honours of this poor cottage to you.&nbsp; There is a chamber
above this, containing the only bed in the hut; thither you may
go and rest, for otherwise it will certainly be vacant to-night:
I shall find a bed in the village; and Evan sleeps near you with
some of the guests in the barn.&nbsp; But, before I go, if my
question be not unwelcome and intrusive, tell me who you are, and
whither you are bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;I was ever somewhat of a subscriber to the old
man&rsquo;s creed of fatalism,&rdquo; said the stranger, smiling,
&ldquo;and I believe I am more confirmed in it by the singular
events of this day.&nbsp; My father was a man of a certain rank
in society, but of selfish and disorderly habits.&nbsp; A course
of extravagance and idleness was succeeded by difficulties and
distress.&nbsp; Harassed by creditors, he was pained by their
demands, and his selfishness was unable to endure the sufferings
of his wife and children.&nbsp; Instead of exertion, he had
recourse to flight, and left us to face the difficulties from
which he shrunk.&nbsp; He was absent for years, while his family
toiled and struggled with success.&nbsp; Suddenly we heard that
he was concealed in this part of the coast; the cause which made
that concealment necessary I forbear to mention; but he as
suddenly disappeared from the eyes of men, though we never could
trace him beyond this part of the country.&nbsp; I have always
believed that I should one day find my father, and have lately,
though with difficulty, prevailed upon my mother to allow me to
make my inquiries in this neighbourhood; but my search is at an
end to-day,&mdash;I believe that I have found my father.&nbsp;
Roaming along the beach, I penetrated into several of those dark
caverns of the rocks, which might well, by <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>their rugged
aspects, deter the idle and the timid from entering.&nbsp;
Through the fissures of one I discovered, in the interior, a
light.&nbsp; Surprised, I penetrated to its concealment, and
discovered a man sleeping on the ground.&nbsp; I advanced to
awake him, and found but a fleshless skeleton, cased in tattered
and decaying garments.&nbsp; He had probably met his death by
accident, for exactly over the corpse I observed, at a terrific
distance, the daylight, as if streaming down from an aperture
above.&nbsp; Thus the wretched man must have fallen, but how long
since, or who had discovered his body, and left the light which I
beheld, I knew not, though I cannot help cherishing a strong
conviction that it was the body of Rhys Meredith that I
saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who talks of Rhys Meredith,&rdquo; said a stern voice
near the coffin, &ldquo;and of the cave where the outcast
rots?&rdquo;&nbsp; They turned quickly at the sound, and beheld
Ruth Tudor standing up, as if she had been intently listening to
the story.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was I who spoke, dame,&rdquo; said the
stranger gently, &ldquo;and my speech was of my father, of Rhys
Meredith; I am Owen his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son!&nbsp; Owen Rhys!&rdquo; said the bewildered Ruth,
passing her hand over her forehead, as if to enable her to
recover the combinations of these <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>names; &ldquo;and who art thou, that
thus givest human ties to him who is no more of humanity? why
speakest thou of living things as pertaining to the dead?&nbsp;
Father! he is father to nought save sin, and murder is his only
begotten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She advanced to the traveller as she spoke, and again caught a
view of his face; again he saw the wild look of recognition, and
an unearthly shriek followed the convulsive horror of her
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I knew
it must be thyself; once before to-night have I beheld thee, yet
what can thy coming bode?&nbsp; Back with thee, ruffian! for is
not thy dark work done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us leave her,&rdquo; said the good pastor,
&ldquo;to the care of her attendant; do not continue to meet her
gaze your presence may increase, but cannot allay her malady: go
up to your bed and rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He retired as he spoke; and Owen, in compliance with his wish,
ascended the ruinous stair which led to his chamber, after he had
beheld Ruth Tudor quietly place herself in her seat at the open
coffin&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; The room to which he mounted was not
of the most cheering aspect, yet he felt that he had often slept
soundly in a worse.&nbsp; It was a gloomy unfinished chamber, and
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>the wind
was whistling coldly and drearily through the uncovered rafters
above his head.&nbsp; Like many of the cottages in that part of
the country, it appeared to have grown old and ruinous before it
had been finished; for the flooring was so crazy as scarcely to
support the huge wooden bedstead, and in many instances the
boards were entirely separated from each other, and in the
centre, time, or the rot, had so completely devoured the larger
half of one, that through the gaping aperture Owen had an entire
command of the room and the party below, looking down immediately
above the coffin.&nbsp; Ruth was in the same attitude as when he
left her, and the servant girl was dozing by her side.&nbsp;
Every thing being perfectly tranquil, Owen threw himself upon his
hard couch, and endeavoured to compose himself to rest for the
night, but this had become a task, and one of no easy nature to
surmount; his thoughts still wandered to the events of the day,
and he felt there was some strange connexion between the scene he
had just witnessed, and the darker one of the secret cave.&nbsp;
He was an imaginative man, and of a quick and feverish
temperament, and he thought of Ruth Tudor&rsquo;s ravings, and
the wretched skeleton of the rock, till he had worked out in his
brain the chain <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>of events that linked one consequence with the other: he
grew restless and wretched, and amidst the tossings of impatient
anxiety, fatigue overpowered him, and he sunk into a perturbed
and heated sleep.&nbsp; His slumber was broken by dreams that
might well be the shadows of his waking reveries.&nbsp; He was
alone (as in reality) upon his humble bed, when imagination
brought to his ear the sound of many voices again singing the
slow and monotonous psalm; it was interrupted by the outcries of
some unseen things who attempted to enter his chamber, and, amid
yells of fear and execrations of anger, bade him &ldquo;Arise,
and come forth, and aid:&rdquo; then the coffined form which
slept so quietly below, stood by his side, and in beseeching
accents, bade him &ldquo;Arise and save her.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his
sleep he attempted to spring up, but a horrid fear restrained
him, a fear that he should be too late; then he crouched like a
coward beneath his coverings, to hide from the reproaches of the
spectre, while shouts of laughter and shrieks of agony were
poured like a tempest around him: he sprung from his bed and
awoke.</p>
<p>It was some moments ere he could recover recollection, or
shake off the horror which had seized upon his soul.&nbsp; He
listened, and with infinite satisfaction observed an unbroken
silence <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>throughout the house.&nbsp; He smiled at his own
terrors, attributed them to the events of the day, or the
presence of a corse, and determined not to look down into the
lower room till he should be summoned thither in the
morning.&nbsp; He walked to the casement, and looked abroad to
the night; the clouds were many, black, and lowering, and the
face of the sky looked angrily at the wind, and glared
portentously upon the earth; the <i>sleet</i> was still falling;
distant thunder announced the approach or departure of a storm,
and Owen marked the clouds coming from afar towards him, laden
with the rapid and destructive lightning: he shut the casement
and returned towards his bed; but the light from below attracted
his eye, and he could not pass the aperture without taking one
glance at the party.</p>
<p>They were in the same attitude in which he had left them; the
servant was sleeping, but Ruth was earnestly gazing on the lower
end of the room upon something, without the sight of Owen; his
attention was next fixed upon the corpse, and he thought he had
never seen any living thing so lovely; and so calm was the aspect
of her last repose, that Meredith thought it more resembled a
temporary suspension of the faculties, than the eternal stupor of
death: her <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>features were pale, but not distorted, and there was
none of the livid hue of death in her beautiful mouth and lips;
but the flowers in her hand gave stronger demonstration of the
presence of the power, before whose potency their little strength
was fading; drooping with a mortal sickness, they bowed down
their heads in submission, as one by one they dropped from her
pale and perishing fingers.&nbsp; Owen gazed, till he thought he
saw the grasp of her hand relax, and a convulsive smile pass over
her cold and rigid features; he looked again; the eye-lids shook
and vibrated like the string of some fine-strung instrument; the
hair rose, and the head cloth moved: he started up ashamed:
&ldquo;Does the madness of this woman affect all who would sleep
beneath her roof?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;what is this that
disturbs me&mdash;or am I yet in a dream?&nbsp; Hark! what is
that?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the voice of Ruth; she had risen from
her seat, and was standing near the coffin, apparently addressing
some one who stood at the lower end of the room: &ldquo;To what
purpose is thy coming now?&rdquo; said she, in a low and
melancholy voice, &ldquo;and at what dost thou laugh and gibe?
lo! you; she is here, and the sin you know of, cannot be; how can
I take the <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>life which another hath already withdrawn?&nbsp; Go, go,
hence to thy cave of night, for this is no place of safety for
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her thoughts now took another turn; she seemed
to hide one from the pursuit of others; &ldquo;Lie still! lie
still!&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;put out thy light! so, so,
they pass by and mark thee not; thou art safe; good night, good
night! now will I home to sleep;&rdquo; and she seated herself in
her chair, as if composing her senses to rest.</p>
<p>Owen was again bewildered in the chaos of thought, but for
this time he determined to subdue his imagination, and, throwing
himself upon his bed, again gave himself up to sleep; but the
images of his former dreams still haunted him, and their hideous
phantasms were more powerfully renewed; again he heard the solemn
psalm of death, but unsung by mortals&mdash;it was pealed through
earth up to the high heaven, by myriads of the viewless and the
mighty: again he heard the execrations of millions for some
unremembered sin, and the wrath and the hatred of a world was
rushing upon him: &ldquo;Come forth! come forth!&rdquo; was the
cry; and amid yells and howls they were darting upon him, when
the pale form of the beautiful dead arose between them, <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and shielded
him from their malice; but he heard her say aloud, &ldquo;It is
for this, that thou wilt not save me; arise, arise, and
help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprung up as he was commanded; sleeping or waking he never
knew; but he started from his bed to look down into the chamber,
as he heard the voice of Ruth loud in terrific denunciation: he
looked; she was standing, uttering yells of madness and rage, and
close to her was a well-known form of appalling
recollection&mdash;his father, as he had seen him last; he arose
and darted to the door: &ldquo;I am mad,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I
am surely mad, or this is still a continuation of my
dream:&rdquo; he looked again; Ruth was still there, but
alone.</p>
<p>But, though no visible form stood by the maniac, some fiend
had entered her soul, and mastered her mighty spirit; she had
armed herself with an axe, and shouting, &ldquo;Liar, liar,
hence!&rdquo; was pursuing some imaginary foe to the darker side
of the cottage: Owen strove hard to trace her motions, but as she
had retreated under the space occupied by his bed, he could no
longer see her, and his eyes involuntarily fastened themselves
upon the coffin; there a new horror met them; the dead corpse had
risen, and with wild and glaring eyes was watching the scene
before <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>her.&nbsp; Owen distrusted his senses till he heard the
terrific voice of Ruth, as she marked the miracle he had
witnessed; &ldquo;The fiend, the robber!&rdquo; she yelled,
&ldquo;it is he who hath entered the pure body of my child.&nbsp;
Back to thy cave of blood, thou lost one! back to thine own dark
hell!&rdquo;&nbsp; Owen flew to the door; it was too late; he
heard the shriek&mdash;the blow: he <i>fell</i> into the room,
but only in time to hear the second blow, and see the cleft hand
of the hapless Rachel fall back upon its bloody pillow; his
terrible cries brought in the sleepers from the barn, headed by
the wretched Evan, and, for a time, the thunders of heaven were
drowned in the clamorous grief of man.&nbsp; No one dared to
approach the miserable Ruth, who now, in utter frenzy, strode
around the room, brandishing, with diabolical grandeur, the
bloody axe, and singing a wild song of triumph and joy.&nbsp; All
fell back as she approached, and shrunk from the infernal majesty
of her terrific form; and the thunders of heaven rolling above
their heads, and the flashings of the fires of eternity in their
eyes, were less terrible than the savage glare and desperate
wrath of the maniac:&mdash;suddenly, the house rocked to its
foundation; its inmates were blinded for a moment, and sunk,
felled by a stunning blow, to the earth;&mdash;slowly each man <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>recovered and
arose, wondering he was yet alive;&mdash;all were unhurt, save
one.&nbsp; Ruth Tudor was on the earth, her blackened limbs
prostrate beneath the coffin of her child, and her dead cheek
resting on the rent and bloody axe;&mdash;it had been the
destroyer of both.</p>

YELLOW DWARF.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A TALE OF THE ORANGE TREE.</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Oranges and Lemons.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> body knows, or at least ought
to know, with what an uproar of delight the birth of an heir to
any noble family was celebrated in the old baronial times of
fisty-cuff memory; exactly such a festival would we, the humble
historian of the illustrious house of Tecklenburgh, describe, if
we knew how to render justice to the outrageous mirth which shook
the old castle to its very foundation, on the day of the eventful
morn on which the lady of the eldest son of the family had
presented her lord, and his no less expecting father the count,
with a new prop to the seat of their ancient dignities.&nbsp; It
was amid the mingled uproar of trumpets, bells, soldiers, women,
horses, and dogs, that the respectable purple-nosed dominican,
who was confessor to the family, gave a <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>blessing and
a name to its future representative; and immediately after the
ceremony, the knights and nobles, wearied by the blows given and
received in the jousts, retired to the dining hall with the
threefold intention of filling their empty stomachs with
something better than the east wind, solacing their spirits with
the biting jests of the count&rsquo;s fool, and curing their
wounds and bruises of the morning by bathing them in flagons of
rhenish, till the moon should look down upon the evening.</p>
<p>But happiness will not endure for ever; like riches, she
maketh herself wings and fleeth away: the company, after picking
the flesh of the huge wild boar to the bone, began to stare at
each other with bleared eyes, ask querulous questions with
stuttering tongues, and reply with solemn and important visages;
and the count of Tecklenburgh, fearing that his youngest son, the
handsome Sir Ludolph, would soon grow as wise as the rest of the
party, and of course utterly unfit for business, withdrew him
quietly from the table and conducted him to his private
apartment; there, seating himself in his state chair and enrobing
his person, with an air of paternal dignity he solemnly demanded
of his son, if he had, according to his particular order,
considered the <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>subject of their last conference.&nbsp; The young knight
answered, without any hesitation, that he had not, for that the
subject was so disagreeable to him that he had never suffered it
to enter his mind since; that he was determined not to become a
monk, that he thought the tonsure excessively unbecoming, and
that he had no inclination to pray every time St.
Benedict&rsquo;s bells should ring; and he added moreover, that
he was resolved to carve himself out a fortune with his sword,
and for that purpose intended to set off immediately for the
court of the injured princes of Thuringia, whose cause was a just
and honourable one, and make them an offer of his services: all
this was said with an air of so much determination and composure,
as partly to disturb, and partly to amuse the gravity of the
count of Tecklenburgh; but considering within himself for a few
moments, he thought this last project of his son was not quite so
foolish as he had at first been willing to imagine it.&nbsp; In
addition to high courage and many knightly acquirements, Ludolph
possessed a very handsome person, and this idea connecting itself
with the beautiful sister of the princes of Thuringia, he began
to think that it would be a pity to hide that fine form under a
greasy cassock; he reflected that should the three sons of <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Albert the
Depraved get their brains knocked out in the skirmish, (a
consummation devoutly to be wished, and, from their warlike
character and powerful enemies, very likely to happen,) their
possessions would descend to their sister, who might possibly
fall in love with his handsome son, and then possibly the
margraviate of Thuringia might finally centre in his
family.&nbsp; These, and many other possibilities working in the
brain of father Tecklenburgh, worked a change in his countenance
also; and Ludolph seeing a smile, or something like one, hovering
over his iron features, judged it a favourable opportunity for
re-enforcing his petition, which he did with all the zeal and
eloquence he could muster&mdash;eloquence which touched the heart
of his tender father, for he assured him that if he would permit
him to depart, he would not draw the smallest piece of copper
from his treasury to fit him out for the expedition, but would
make his aunt&rsquo;s legacy of relics answer every
purpose.&nbsp; This last remonstrance settled the business; count
Tecklenburgh, finding it was to cost him nothing, gave his
consent to the measure, and made his son happy in his own way,
though, if that happiness had cost him a single cruitzner, he
would have held fast to the tonsure in spite of all the
repugnance of <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>poor Ludolph; as it was, he gave him his blessing, and
dismissed him with much good advice, but not a single coin, and
the knight was too happy in the granted permission to grieve at
his father&rsquo;s lack of liberality.&nbsp; With a lightened
heart he went for his holy legacy, which he found much heavier
than he had expected; every bone and rag was carefully marked
with the name of its original owner, and, after getting the monk
to read him their titles, and affix a value to each article, he
hastened to dispose of his sanctified treasure.&nbsp; He imagined
the most likely persons to bid handsomely for his commodities
would be the monks, who paid such respectful and humble reverence
to cargoes of that description; but, after visiting a convent of
Dominicans situated near the castle, in this instance he found
himself most grievously mistaken; these holy pedlars were much
too wise to buy what they had long found their account in
selling: they had already a good stock on hand, and, when this
should be exhausted, they could manufacture others at a much
cheaper rate than they could purchase them of count Ludolph: so
he carried his legacy to the nuns, who rejected it
instantaneously, doubting whether the articles were
genuine.&nbsp; From the nuns he went to all the orders of
mendicants, who treated <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>him and his relics with great
contempt, cried down his cargo, and impudently asserted that the
leg of St. Bridget, which he had considered the most valuable
article in the pious collection, was the leg of a woman who was
hung some years before for sorcery in Nuremburg, as they
themselves had the real original limb of the saint in their
possession.&nbsp; Thus disappointed among the shorn lambs of the
fold, Ludolph determined to seek for purchasers among the laity,
and accordingly found them in the persons of priest-ridden
princes, crusading nobles, pilgrim knights, and convent-founding
ladies: the great variety of his good aunt&rsquo;s collection
enabled him to gratify the tastes of all, for his box contained
one member or other of every saint mentioned in the monk of
Treves&rsquo;s martyrology.&nbsp; St. Bridget&rsquo;s leg he sold
at a high price to a miserable old noble who had grown rich by
rapine, and who trusted by this measure to scare away the goblins
and spectres who nightly kept their revels round his bed.&nbsp;
The thumb of St. Austin was purchased by a beautiful princess, as
the guard of her chastity amid the allurements of a court, and
was suspended like a camphor bag around her delicate neck; while
the illustrious mother of a reprobate young knight earnestly
hoped, by tacking a piece of the <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>hair shirt of St. Jerome to the shirt
of her son, to effect a reformation in his morals, and an
amendment in his manners.&nbsp; There were always abundance of
fools in the world, and in those unlettered times it did not
require the light of a lantern to look for them.&nbsp; Ludolph
thought so, as, with a lightened box but a heavy purse, he
returned to Tecklenburgh to fit out for his expedition.&nbsp;
Hosen, boots, vests, tunics, hoods, harness, and arms, were all
ready in a short time; for when a man has money, every thing else
under the sun is very much at his service.&nbsp; His appointments
were all of the handsomest kind; his device was a boar, and his
colours were blue and scarlet.&nbsp; And thus, having equipped
the knight and sent him forward, let us look back for a little,
to ascertain whither he is going, and for what purpose when he
shall arrive there.</p>
<p>The cause of the princes of Thuringia was, as count Ludolph
had truly stated, a just and honourable one: their father, Albert
the Depraved, had disinherited them, and banished their mother,
in favour of a worthless mistress and his illegitimate son, for
whom he anxiously endeavoured to procure the investiture of his
dominions after his decease.&nbsp; Not succeeding in this notable
project, and bent upon the ruin of his own children, he <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>sold his
landgraviate of Misnia to the emperor Adolphus, who dying before
he could be benefited by his purchase, bequeathed this right, to
which he had no right at all, to his brother Philip of Nassau,
who, poor in character, and still poorer in purse, was now
levying an army, aided by the emperor Albert, to deprive the
legitimate heir, Frederic with the Bite, and his brother Dictman,
of their rights and possessions.&nbsp; To this project they were
by no means disposed to consent, more especially as their mother,
Margaret, daughter of Frederic the Redbeard, continually kept
alive their resentment against their worthless father and his
abandoned associates.&nbsp; This princess, on being years before
separated from her children by her husband, had requested
permission to take leave of them ere their departure, which being
granted, she, in the frenzy of rage and grief, left a singular
memorial of her wrongs with her eldest son; she bit a piece out
of his cheek, and the impression remaining upon his face for
ever, inflamed his indignation against the original author of
this disfigurement; so that, when capable of bearing arms, he
deposed his father and assumed his place, to thrust him from
which Philip of Nassau was now threatening, and to oppose whom
half Germany was rising in arms <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>to assist the cheek-bitten Frederic,
and among many others the handsome knight of Tecklenburgh.</p>
<p>Margaret of Suabia, the mother of the princes, during the
early part of her life, had been confined by her husband in the
castle of Wartzburg, in order that she might be removed the more
readily into a still smaller abode, whenever the proper
opportunity should occur, and which he piously determined not to
neglect.&nbsp; She was at this period in a situation which might
have interested any man but such a husband, for she promised to
increase his illustrious family by an additional son or daughter;
but as he cared for no children but the son of his mistress
Cunegunda, this circumstance rather operated against the poor
princess, who was left to amuse herself as well as she could in
superintending the infancy of her sons, and hunting in the
haunted forest of Eisenac.&nbsp; One day, while thus diverting
her attention from the many anxieties which oppressed her, she
found herself suddenly separated from her attendants; but hearing
a horn sound to the right, she spurred on her palfrey in that
direction, till, after an hour&rsquo;s hard riding, she began to
fear she was removing still further from her people, for no sound
could she hear but that of the eternal <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>bugle, no hoof-tramp but that of her
own steed.&nbsp; Still the horn sounded, and still the princess
galloped, till at length, wearied by her exercise, and finding
herself in a large open plain, she dismounted to reconnoitre; at
the same moment she remarked the silence of the horn, and the
appearance of a gigantic orange tree, loaded with fine fruit, in
the centre of the tranquil plain.&nbsp; Astonishment she
certainly felt on beholding so extraordinary and beautiful an
object; but hunger and fatigue had entirely banished all notions
of fear; besides, dame Margaret, having no small share of the
curiosity of her grandmother Eve, could no more resist the
temptation of tasting these oranges, than the first woman did the
apple; so climbing up into the tree, she regaled herself to her
heart&rsquo;s content with this fine fruit of the forest.&nbsp;
By the time she had fairly dined, and was as weary of eating as
she had previously been of riding, she bethought her of the boys
at home, and with what glee they would have marched to the sack
of the orange tree; but as that was not possible, she determined
they should not be without share of the spoil, and therefore
began to fill her huge pockets with the ripest and largest of the
fruit.&nbsp; But this action displeased the hospitable master of
the table at which she had been <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>so plentifully regaled; &ldquo;Eat,
but take nothing away,&rdquo; had been one of his maxims, and he
was mortally offended to see this honest rule set at nought in
the person of a princess, a lady who, he thought, ought to have
understood better manners.&nbsp; Before, therefore, she had laid
up provisions for the march, a little shrill voice from the tree
commanded her highness &ldquo;not to steal his fruit,&rdquo; and,
at the same instant, there issued from the trunk, which opened to
give him a passage, a figure which effectually satisfied the
curiosity of the princess of Suabia.&nbsp; The animal which now
quickly ascended the tree, and placed himself <i>vis &agrave;
vis</i> with her highness, was a little deformed man, about three
feet and a half high, with a face as yellow as the oranges upon
which he lived, hair of the same hue hanging down to his heels,
and a monstrous beard, of the same bilious complexion, gracefully
descending to his feet; if you add to this, the gaiety of his
yellow doublet, short cloak, and hose, you will not wonder that
Margaret did not altogether relish the <i>t&ecirc;te &agrave;
t&ecirc;te</i> in which she found herself so suddenly and
singularly placed, independent of the awkwardness of paying a
first visit in the boughs of a tree.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; said the little yellow devil, after
staring at her some time with his two <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>huge goggling yellow eyes,
&ldquo;what business have you here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
lost my way,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and being fatigued, was
going to gather an orange to appease my hunger:&rdquo; but he,
without the least respect for his guest, or the rank of an
emperor&rsquo;s daughter, rudely answered, &ldquo;Woman, you lie!
you were stealing my property to carry away.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this
insolent reproach, Margaret, whose patience was never proverbial,
felt a strong inclination to treat the demon as she afterwards
did her son; but fearing that the little gentleman might not
endure it quite so temperately, prudently restrained this effort
of her indignation, and only said, &ldquo;I did not know the tree
had any other owner than myself, or I would not have gathered
any; what I have eaten I cannot restore, but here is the last I
have taken;&rdquo; and she threw it rather roughly at the Dwarf,
who, irritated excessively at this behaviour, told her, grinning
hideously, and exhibiting for her admiration his monstrous
overgrown yellow claws, that he had a strong temptation to tear
her to pieces, which nothing but his wish to be allied to the
blood of the emperors should have prevented.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
oranges,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which you have stolen, I estimate
above all price, except that which I am going to demand: I am a
powerful demon, and <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>rule with unbounded sway many thousand spirits; but I am
unhappy in not having a wife with whom to share my power; as Adam
was not delighted in Paradise, neither am I in my Orange Tree,
without a companion.&nbsp; You are about to present an infant to
your lord, who is utterly indifferent about the matter; it will
be a girl, and I demand her in marriage on the day she will be
twenty years old: consent to be my mother, and I will avenge your
injuries upon your husband, and load you with honours and riches;
refuse, and I will tear you in pieces this moment, and furnish my
supper table with your carcase.&rdquo;&nbsp; Margaret, who had
never been so terrified in all her life, and would not only have
given her daughter, but her sons and husband into the bargain, to
have got away, readily promised to agree with the Dwarf&rsquo;s
wishes, who now became exceedingly polite, embraced his dear
mother, and assured her of his devotion.&nbsp; He then informed
her he would give her notice some months before he should claim
his wife, placed her carefully and tenderly upon her palfrey, and
mounting behind, spurred on the animal, who flew like the wind to
the entrance of the forest; where again embracing his good
mother, he dismounted and disappeared.&nbsp; Margaret, freed from
the odious company of the <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Yellow Dwarf, began to reflect with
no very pleasant feelings upon her present adventure and future
prospects.&nbsp; She was, indeed, safe out of the orange-coloured
clutches of her dutiful and well-beloved son; and, vexed as she
was by the horrible promise she had been obliged to make, she
could not help congratulating herself with great sincerity upon
this circumstance, and began, like all who have just escaped a
present danger, to make light of the evils in the distance.&nbsp;
The farther she cantered from the Orange Tree, the easier her
mind became; and taking a few hints from &ldquo;Time, the
comforter,&rdquo; she reflected that many things might occur
before the expiration of twenty years: it was a long period to
look forward; the little yellow devil might die, (and, indeed,
she could not but allow that he looked most miserably ill,) or he
might forget his bargain, or he might be conquered and killed by
some black, pea-green, or true blue devil, who might be stronger
or more powerful than himself; or, in case of the worst, she
could secure her daughter in some strong castle or convent, or
marry her, before the expiration of the term, to some prince
capable of protecting her; at all events, thought Margaret,
&ldquo;sufficient to the day is the evil thereof;&rdquo; and,
delighted by these soothing reflections, and <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>charmed to
find herself in a whole skin, she trotted along with great
complacency, and arrived quite comforted before the gates of
Wartzburg.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These yellow cowslip cheeks,<br />
And eyes as green as leeks.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Twenty</span> years is indeed a long
period to look forward, but a very short one to look back, and so
thought the now widowed princess, when, nineteen years and some
months after her adventure in the forest, she sat beside her
lovely daughter in the palace of Erfurt, listening with earnest
and tender attention to the plans of her warlike sons, for
wresting their dominions from the iron grasp of Albert the
One-eyed and Philip of Nassau.&nbsp; It was necessary that they
should give battle to their enemies; and as the margrave of
Misnia intended to fight for his country in person, this would
unavoidably deprive her beloved daughter of that powerful
protection which hitherto had been her security against the
threats of the Yellow Dwarf.&nbsp; It now wanted but six months
of the period when he had determined to claim his bride; and as
he had not hitherto given any indication, according to his word,
of his appearance <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>for this purpose, she trusted he might have forgotten it
altogether, and, quietly resolving not to complain of this breach
of promise, forbore to mention the subject to her children.</p>
<p>One day, during the bustle of preparation for the approaching
warfare, a knight, splendidly attired, arrived at the palace, and
demanded to be introduced to the princess Margaret, who no sooner
beheld him, than she recognised in the colour of his arms the
livery of her dear son-in-law, the Dwarf of the Orange
Tree.&nbsp; He announced himself as the knight of the king of the
oranges, and his embassy was to place abundance of gold at the
feet of the princess Margaret, and to carry away her daughter as
the bride of his master.&nbsp; Concealment was no longer
possible, so sending for her children, she informed them of her
forest adventure, and its unfortunate result.&nbsp; Poor Brunilda
fainted away; her brothers swore as lustily as ever queen
Elizabeth did, and fairly bullied the knight ambassador for his
presumption in daring to think of their sister as a helpmate for
the little dirty low-lived sorcerer his master; and Margaret, who
before their entrance had been absolutely terrified to death by
his presence, now finding herself protected, suffered her tongue
to wag at a most unconscionable rate against the poor <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>ambassador.&nbsp; She told him she had a great mind to
cut off his ears, for bringing her such a message; that his
master was a little conceited monster; that if, with all this
gold and silver, he would buy a fine castle, cut off his beard,
and live like a gentleman, he should not want her interest with
one of the dairy-maids, but as it was, the thing was utterly
impossible, he would not succeed even with the lowest
scullion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied the knight, with a
grim kind of gravity, which was not half relished by the
princess, &ldquo;I would have you to understand I came not hither
to bandy words with you, nor to listen to a catalogue of my
master&rsquo;s perfections: I must, however, inform you, that he
would not part from his Orange Tree, nor with his beard, for all
the princesses in the universe, the fair Brunilda included.&nbsp;
If you do not think proper to keep your promise, he will find
means to oblige you: neither does he require human aid to obtain
his betrothed bride; but his gallantry and good nature will not
allow him to force the will of the fair princess, if he can
relinquish his determination with honour.&nbsp; He is fully aware
of your present repugnance to his nuptials, and he is now
whispering me to say, that if the princess herself declines his
vows (which he can hardly believe), <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>he will release her upon condition of
her finding a champion that shall conquer me, and afterwards my
invincible master, before the six months have expired, in single
combat on horseback, on foot, with lance or sword, according to
his highness&rsquo;s good pleasure at the time of meeting: shall
I say these terms are accepted?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
may,&rdquo; replied the margrave, to whom these conditions did
not appear very hard, and who thought it better to comply with
than refuse them, as he was not aware of the strength of the
enemy to whom his mother&rsquo;s promise had really been given;
and he remembered he should probably be compelled to leave his
lovely sister unprotected, while absent on his distant
wars.&nbsp; The arrangements were, therefore, soon made, and the
yellow champion was satisfied.</p>
<p>And now a splendid scene opened to view in the territories of
Frederic with the bitten cheek.&nbsp; No sooner each day had the
bells rung out the hour of prime, than the trumpet sounded to
proclaim the challenge of the yellow knight, and the promise of
the margrave of Misnia, that the successful champion of the fair
Brunilda should obtain her hand for his reward.&nbsp; Day after
day did some knight essay the adventure; and day after day did
the noble Margaret enter the lists, attended <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>by her lovely
daughter, who looked, through her fan of peacock&rsquo;s
feathers, as charming, and carried herself as
&ldquo;daintily,&rdquo; as whilom did the beauteous Esther, when
she entered into the presence of the loving Ahasuerus.&nbsp; But
not like that beautiful daughter of the scorners of pork did she
obtain her petition; for day after day was she compelled to
witness the ruin of her hopes in the repeated triumphs of the
yellow Haman over her own black, brown, or party-coloured
champions: knight after knight fell beneath his ponderous arm,
and were obliged to resign their claims to the fair Brunilda, to
her infinite regret, and their bitter mortification.&nbsp;
Already had the counts of Wartzburg, Oettingen, Henneberg, Hanau,
and Conrad of Reida, been compelled to acknowledge the
superiority of his powerful arm, when the arrival of the handsome
knight of Tecklenburgh, who just came in time to hear a
week&rsquo;s rest proclaimed, in order to gain time for the
approach of other knights from the more distant parts of Germany
to the aid of the endangered princess, revived the hopes of
Brunilda.&nbsp; He came, he saw, he conquered&mdash;not the sword
of the yellow champion, but the heart of the charming princess,
which was formed of too tender materials to hold out against so
well-looking and redoubted a warrior: <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>she fell instantly in love with him
to distraction, and he, on his part, was too well bred to be
behind-hand.&nbsp; In the extravagance of her fondness, she
thought all things possible to her lover, and made no doubt that
he would be victorious in the combat.&nbsp; Ludolph was precisely
of the same opinion, and, to manifest its justice, was most
irritably impatient for the day of combat, which was still at the
distance of several halting sun-risings and sun-settings, which
that long-legged old ragamuffin Time did not carry off, in the
opinion of the lovers, quite so rapidly as he ought to have
done.</p>
<p>But it came at last, that day, that morning of miracles; it
came, and brought nothing with it to daunt the brave spirit of
the knight of Tecklenburgh.&nbsp; Light as the plume in his
casque, gay as the colours of his harness, he entered the lists,
and gallantly opposed his person against the ponderous carcase of
the yellow-coloured champion.&nbsp; Blow after blow was freely
given, and as freely received, till the spectators began to doubt
whether either of the men before them was really made of flesh
and blood.&nbsp; Proof decisive, however, was soon given, for the
sword of Ludolph cleft the helmet of his antagonist, and dashed
his weapon from his hand, so that, defenceless <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>and at the
mercy of his conqueror, he yielded up his claim to victory, and
was content to beg his life.&nbsp; The acclamations of the people
proved to Ludolph the difficulty of the conquest he had just
achieved.&nbsp; The nobles were all anxious to testify their
esteem and admiration, though some in their hearts were bursting
with envy, and felt themselves almost choked by the fine things
they thought it necessary to utter.&nbsp; Ludolph took them all
in good faith, with perfect confidence in their sincerity, for he
was too happy and too honest to suspect; and then turning to the
poor champion, whom he hardly allowed time to recover breath,
recommended him to return to his little lord, and bear his
defiance, as he should quietly wait to fulfil the last condition
ere he received the hand of the beautiful Brunilda.&nbsp; The
Yellow Champion took the advice thus kindly offered him, and
quitted the palace of Erfurt, leaving his conqueror busy enough
in accepting those disinterested professions of service which are
seldom offered except to those who do not want them, or from whom
an adequate return may not unreasonably be expected.</p>
<p>Ludolph waited with great impatience the Dwarf&rsquo;s reply
to his challenge.&nbsp; His time was passed, meanwhile, in making
love to the princess <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>(who on her part was tolerably well
disposed to listen to him), and laying up a stock of devotion, by
prayer and fasting, to serve, as occasion should warrant, in the
approaching combat with the demon, of whose power he had formed
other notions, since his residence in the Misnian court, than
either thinking him so harmless or so insignificant as he had
formerly done.&nbsp; But the days rolled on, and no dwarf
appeared.&nbsp; Margaret, who sincerely admired the valour of
Ludolph, was anxious to end his suspense, and Brunilda&rsquo;s
terrors, by uniting him at once to her daughter, without waiting
for the presence of the Lord of the Orange Tree, of whom she
could never think without shuddering; but the margrave, who, much
as he loved his sister and her noble deliverer, was too much of a
gentleman to break his word, even with a dwarf, determined they
should stay the full time allotted by the demon.&nbsp; The latter
was too gallant, and too much in love with the princess, to
forget his engagement, and accordingly one morning, as the
trumpets were sounding the usual summons to the lists, the Dwarf
himself entered them in his customary dress, mounted upon a
yellow steed, and surrounded by a large troop of knights in his
colours.&nbsp; The nobles and ladies of the margrave&rsquo;s <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>court, struck
by the oddity of his appearance, entirely forgot their
politeness, and burst into as hearty and unanimous a laugh as
ever was heard in our lower House at any of Joe H&mdash;&rsquo;s
blunders.&nbsp; But it was no laughing matter to Brunilda: she
saw, for the first time, her intended husband, and she felt that
his ugliness even exceeded her mother&rsquo;s report, and heaven
knows that had not been flattering.&nbsp; She cast a look of
tender entreaty upon Ludolph, who, impatient to punish his rival
and relieve her anxiety, couched his lance, and spurred forward
to meet the demon, who, not to be behind-hand in courtesy,
advanced to receive him.&nbsp; But the knight suddenly sprung
back, on observing the singular dress of his adversary, the
extraordinary lightness of whose accoutrements struck him with
astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir knight of the Orange Tree,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;except the lance in your hand and the sword in
your belt, I see no sort of preparation for a combat; sheathe
your person in harness, I pray you, that so at least the chances
may be more equal between us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is that to
thee?&rdquo; replied the Dwarf; &ldquo;it is my pleasure to fight
in these garments: thief as thou art, conquer me in them if thou
canst.&nbsp; For thee, sweet lady, I am here, to prove my right
to thy hand, to rescue it from this craven, and fear not <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>but I shall
deserve it: my palace is ready, thy dowry is ready, and twice a
thousand slaves wait to obey thy wishes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ludolph
could not endure this insolence, so rushing forward as the yellow
knights retired from the person of their leader, he began a most
furious attack upon the animal who pretended to rival him in the
affections of his lady.&nbsp; Alas! poor Brunilda! if she had
trembled before, during the combats with the yellow knight, what
anxiety must not have filled her bosom now!&nbsp; The lances were
soon shivered to pieces: the champions drew their swords, but
seemed to make very little impression with them.&nbsp; Ludolph
had not yet received a wound, and yellow-jacket seemed determined
to make good his boast, and hold the knight of Tecklenburgh a
tug.&nbsp; Vain was all the skill and strength of the latter;
though he struck with all his might and main, and heart and soul,
he could not cut through a single hair of the Dwarf&rsquo;s long
beard, which seemed to wag at him in derision.&nbsp; Poor
Brunilda sat as uneasily upon her canopied throne as if she had
been upon a bed of nettles.&nbsp; She prayed to all the saints in
heaven, and St. Henry the Limper in particular, to assist her
dear knight in this terrible combat: but St. Henry the Limper was
not in good humour, or was otherwise engaged, <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>for he did
not appear to pay the least attention to her request, and Ludolph
was left to fight it out by himself as he could.&nbsp; In truth,
he did not want inclination to put an end to the business.&nbsp;
After pegging and poking at every inch of the Dwarf&rsquo;s
invulnerable carcase, he espied a little unguarded spot on the
left side of his throat, exactly open to his right hand.&nbsp;
Delighted by the prospect of slicing off his ragamuffin head, he
aimed a mighty blow with all his force, which the little demon
parried; he struck a second with no better success; but the third
was triumphant, for it sent the yellow head flying from the
shoulders, and bounding to another part of the area.&nbsp; The
knight leaped from his saddle to seize the head and hold it up to
the view of the people; but in this race, to his horror, he was
outstripped by the Dwarf himself, who likewise, darting from his
horse, flew to the head, grasped it firmly, gave it a shake,
clapped it upon his shoulders, and fixed it again as firmly and
steadily as ever.&nbsp; Then, ere the spectators could recover
from the stupor into which this unexpected contretemps had thrown
them, he struck the staring Ludolph to the ground, seized the
princess by her flowing locks, swung her behind him, and bolted
out of the area.&nbsp; His knights wheeled round to follow <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>him, but the
Misnian nobles, recovering from their confusion, surrounded them
with drawn swords, and began a desperate battle, in which it
appeared they clearly had the worst, only hacking and hewing each
other; for the knights, squires, pages, and horses of the enemy
suddenly vanished from their sight, and in their places appeared
a waggon load of oranges bowling and rolling about the area in
the most amusing manner possible.&nbsp; It was some time ere the
nobles could direct their attention to the unfortunate count of
Tecklenburgh, who, stunned by the blow given to him as the
parting blessing of the spiteful Dwarf, was lying insensible on
the ground: the moment he recovered, he declared his intention of
pursuing the enemy, in which he was seconded by all the knights
present, who, headed by Margaret as guide and commander, resolved
to storm the Orange Tree itself, and liberate the captive
damsel.&nbsp; They set forward with great courage and in good
order; but they might just as effectively have stayed at home,
for, after wandering about the forest for three days, they
returned crestfallen enough, not only being unable to discover
the Orange Tree, but even the plain in which it stood!&nbsp; Poor
Ludolph, whom the princes had vainly endeavoured to comfort with
the assurance <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>that he had fairly gained the victory, though he had
lost the fruit of it, did not return with them.&nbsp; They lost
him from their company the first day of their search, and they
firmly and devoutly believed the yellow devil had hooked him also
in his infernal claws.&nbsp; Margaret gave herself up to grief,
and her sons, finding nothing else was to be done, endeavoured to
forget theirs in the bustle of the approaching war.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the meantime Brunilda was
jogging on at no easy rate behind the Yellow Dwarf, who, when
arrived at the Orange Tree, opened the trunk by a sign, and,
dismounting, bore his lovely burthen into it.&nbsp; She felt
herself, immediately after, descending a flight of steps, which,
from the duration of time, appeared to be endless.&nbsp; They did
terminate, however, at last, and the Dwarf, placing her roughly
upon her feet, retired swiftly from the place, closing the
entrance at the bottom of the stairs carefully after him.&nbsp;
It was some time after his departure ere Brunilda took courage to
open her eyes and look around her; when she did, she found
herself in a subterraneous apartment as large as the bed-chamber
of the empress <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>Constance. <a name="citation77"></a><a
href="#footnote77" class="citation">[77]</a>&nbsp; Every article
about it was of silver, and there was a magnificence about this
underground palace, which made her conclude it to be the castle
and principal residence of her intended husband, the Yellow
Dwarf, whose company she did not covet, and who, to do him
justice, did not appear to torment her.&nbsp; Food was supplied,
and every attention paid to her wishes by many attendants of both
sexes, who, however, never exchanged one single word in her
hearing.&nbsp; Wearied out by this continual taciturnity, she
began to wish for the sound of a human voice, and, thinking she
might probably learn something of the Dwarf&rsquo;s intentions
from himself, she one day, instead of questioning her dumb
attendants as usual about her lover, demanded some tidings of
their master.&nbsp; &ldquo;He cannot approach your presence,
madam,&rdquo; replied one of the mutes, breaking his hateful
silence, &ldquo;unless you request his appearance.&nbsp; A mighty
spirit, one of the enemies of my master&rsquo;s and your
felicity, has contrived this misfortune by his spells, but, if
you command it, he is permitted to attend you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Brunilda, who, in giving this required permission, never dreamed
<a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>of any
thing more than making inquiries after her family and lover, was
confounded to hear the Dwarf, with the most rapturous
impertinence, volubly thank her for this approval of his, and
generous acknowledgment of her passion.&nbsp; Putting aside his
long beard lest it should throw him down, he knelt fantastically
at her feet, seized her white hand, and declared himself the
happiest of all demon-born beings.&nbsp; It was in vain that
Brunilda reasoned, entreated, and scolded: he protested he was
satisfied with the proofs she had given of her love, and, in
order to spare her modesty the pain of appearing to yield too
soon, he should put a gentle restraint upon her liberty, and not
suffer her to quit his palace till she became his wife.&nbsp; At
this avowal the poor princess grew outrageous; she asked the
little monster how he had dared to select a princess of her
exalted rank to share his hole under ground, and burrow like rats
in the earth? why he had not rather chosen some humble cast-away
maiden, who, having nothing in the world to lose, might be
contented out of it?&nbsp; &ldquo;Rank!&rdquo; replied the
irritated little demon, &ldquo;and what is this rank of which you
are so vain?&nbsp; An imaginary splendour bestowed upon some men
by the cringing servility of others,&mdash;the weak fancy that
decks one with <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>this supremacy, gives birth to the slavish fear that
ensures to him its possession.&nbsp; Rank!&rdquo; continued the
atrabilious little viper, swelling into a respectable width by
the overflowing of his angry venom, &ldquo;rank! it is power
gained by force, won by the sword, by fraud, by oppression!&nbsp;
The strongest is the noblest; and if so, I am more than your
equal, beautiful Brunilda, for, princess as you are, you are my
captive, and I am your master.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brunilda wept at this
insolence, and, like all who know not how to controvert what they
yet cannot bear to acknowledge, hated the Dwarf more than ever,
and resolved to prove it to him by seizing every opportunity of
annoying him.&nbsp; With this laudable intention, she renewed the
attack by commenting with great severity upon his frightful
little person: she sneered at his long beard, short legs, and
large head.&nbsp; She demanded if he had ever looked in a mirror,
and, if he had, how he could presume to imagine he could
captivate any woman under such a detestable form?&nbsp; In no age
have ugly people borne to be laughed at, for, however hideous
they may happen to be, they seldom find it out themselves, and
are, in consequence, very much surprised and offended when
informed of it by others; and, as vanity is usually the reigning
passion of the most disfigured, they <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>seldom pardon an offence which is
mortal.&nbsp; The Dwarf, the ugliest animal the eyes of Brunilda
had ever encountered, could hardly believe this possible, and saw
no joke in her mirth at his expense, and, as he had his full
share of that precious commodity, vanity, he raved, stormed, and
became so insolent, that Brunilda was compelled to order him out
of her presence.&nbsp; This command, which he was obliged to
obey, irritated the little creature to madness, and he swore,
that, since he could not enter her presence without her
permission, he would find a mode of making her give it whenever
he should condescend to require it.&nbsp; This threat had more of
truth in it than Brunilda imagined.&nbsp; A few days after this
animated conversation, the Dwarf sent to ask leave to be allowed
to pay his visit to the princess, which was immediately
refused.&nbsp; This threw him into a rage, and he informed the
princess, by one of his mutes, &ldquo;that her lover Ludolph of
Tecklenburgh was in his power, and that his head should pay for
the scorn with which she thought proper to treat her lord and
husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Brunilda hastily gave the required
permission, upon condition that Ludolph should accompany him; and
her &ldquo;lord and husband,&rdquo; as he styled himself, entered
a few moments after, followed by the knight, whom his <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>demons had
seized in the forest.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, madam,&rdquo; said he,
grinning like Grimaldi, but not so merrily, &ldquo;I found this
stranger in the neighbourhood of my Orange Tree, and I have
brought him hither to secure a welcome for myself.&nbsp; Did I
not tell you I would make you glad to receive me?&nbsp; Here
shall this valorous knight remain, a hostage for your good
behaviour; and never shall you receive him without admitting me
at the same moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brunilda, who would have been
delighted, in her present condition, to have seen any human being
whatever, was in raptures at the sight of Ludolph, who, on his
part, was content with his captivity, since he shared it with
her; and, unrestrained by the presence of the Dwarf, they so
often and so tenderly repeated their mutual delight to each
other, that their grim jailer could not endure the sight of their
happiness, and, rather than witness it, withdrew himself and
Ludolph from the company of Brunilda, which he did not again seek
for some time.&nbsp; When, attended by Ludolph, he next entered
her apartment, his jealous tortures were increased by the renewed
endearments of the lovers, and, resolving in his own mind not to
endure what he flattered himself he could easily remedy, he threw
a spell over the unlucky Brunilda, <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>which he generously hoped would
destroy all the little tranquillity she enjoyed.&nbsp; The charm
operated upon the sight of the princess, who no longer beheld her
lover, but a hideous negro advancing towards her.&nbsp; Brunilda
was terrified, but, reassured by the explanation of the Dwarf,
who felicitated himself on her mortification, she resolved to
punish him in kind; so collecting all the woman in her soul, and
conquering her dislike of the ugly shape he presented to her, she
gave it a most affectionate welcome, and caressed it as her dear
Ludolph.&nbsp; The Dwarf would willingly have annihilated him;
but, obliged to keep him in existence to ensure himself
admittance to Brunilda, he resolved to embitter that existence as
much as lay in his power, and, having once more recourse to his
spells, the handsome Ludolph, unchanged to himself, appeared to
the eyes of the fascinated princess a furious and monstrous
tiger, armed with tremendous fangs and claws.&nbsp; But love
penetrates all disguises, and the princess was now a match for
the sorcerer.&nbsp; She knew that the fangs and claws, however
terrible to others, had no danger for her, and she suffered him
to lie at her feet, kiss her snowy hand, and put his shaggy head
upon her lap, without manifesting the slightest apprehension, to
the great annoyance of <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>the Dwarf, whose dull wit was
sharpened by his jealousy, and he now contrived the master-piece
of spells, to the increased misery of poor Brunilda, over whose
clouded senses the charm once more operating, presented her
beloved Ludolph only under the form of the Yellow Dwarf
himself.&nbsp; This transformation was horrible to both the
sufferers, for each of the figures maintained that he was the
knight, and persisted in execrating the other as the impostor,
while Brunilda, wearied with gazing on their hateful
countenances, dared not afford the slightest notice to either,
lest she should bestow the tenderness designed for Ludolph upon
his detestable rival.&nbsp; In vain did she weep, threaten, and
supplicate the Dwarf to give her lover &ldquo;any shape but
that.&rdquo;&nbsp; She knew not even to which of the pair she
ought to address her petition.&nbsp; But the demon was
inexorable, listened unmoved to her sorrows, for his heart was as
hard as Pharaoh&rsquo;s, and even inwardly laughed at her
agonies.&nbsp; In vain did she examine their features in the hope
of discovering some slight difference that might point out her
lover: both grinned the same ghastly smile,&mdash;both exhibited
the same unvarying ugliness of feature.&nbsp; Alas, poor
Brunilda!&nbsp; Lavater himself could not have assisted thee,
though, hadst thou lived in <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>our days, or Dr. Spurzheim in thine,
some professional examination of the cerebral organisation of the
two dwarfs might have set the question at rest.&nbsp; Doubtless,
some bump extraordinary, some wonderful dilation of the organ of
self-esteem in the skull of the true dwarf, or amativeness or
combativeness in that of the false one, might have aided thee to
discover the unbrutified soul confined in the brutified
body.&nbsp; But, as it was, they were both brutes to Brunilda,
and, as she had no wish to charm the Yellow Dwarf, she wept her
disappointment incessantly.&nbsp; Nor was Ludolph less busy than
the princess in employing threats and prayers by turns to mollify
the Dwarf, though one was to as little purpose as the other, in
the presence of the princess.&nbsp; The cunning demon reiterated
the same whining petition, used the same arguments, and denounced
the same vengeance as the unhappy Ludolph; and when retired from
her apartment, laughed at his success, and replied to every
threat with mingled hate and defiance.&nbsp; It was in vain that
Ludolph accused him of having broken all the laws of chivalry,
held even by demons so sacred.&nbsp; He told him he regarded no
laws, except those which he had made himself.&nbsp; It was to no
purpose he argued his right to be set at liberty at least.&nbsp;
The Dwarf, <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>who was a philosopher in his way, replied that men had
no rights, and that &ldquo;<i>might</i>,&rdquo; which he
possessed, was a much better argument, and a more effective
weapon.&nbsp; All this was unluckily true, but it did not
convince the Westphalian.&nbsp; Zeno, the stoic, said,
&ldquo;that we had two ears, and but one tongue, that we might
hear much and say little.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a wise observation,
and happy are those who profit thereby: our two captives might,
if they had had the good luck ever to have heard it; but as they
had not, they acted directly counter, for they so heartily used
their two tongues, and so entirely spared their four ears, that
their jailer grew outrageous, and therefore, except when he went
to torment Brunilda, he resolved to free himself from the society
of the count of Tecklenburgh, who paid for his garrulity by being
condemned to talk to himself in one of the most dreary dungeons
of the cavern.&nbsp; Here he had full leisure to think of his
misfortunes, and execrate the contriver of them.&nbsp; He prayed
night and morning with all the strength of lungs he could
command, to all the saints in the calendar, to give him a lift
out of this purgatory.&nbsp; He was too good a Christian not to
abhor all thought of magic; but, finding how little notice was
taken of his petition by the higher powers, <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>he could not
help thinking of the lower, and wishing and vowing, that if some
sorcerer, witch, or even devil, would but come to his assistance
now, he would find time enough for repentance hereafter, and heal
his conscience, and propitiate Heaven by many good deeds to be
done in perspective.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would walk to Jerusalem, for
a penance,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or give the spoils I shall take
in my next battle to the church, or I would, when I shall be
able, endow an abbey.&nbsp; Either of these designs would be
satisfactory,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;and oh that I had the
good luck to be able to put them into execution!&nbsp; Oh that
some friendly spirit, some gnome of these caverns, or demon of
this forest, would but come to my assistance!&rdquo;&nbsp; No
sooner said than done: the sinner trembled at the instant
fulfilment of his wicked wish, and began with real alarm to
suspect that he was a bit of a conjurer himself; for there arose
in a moment, from the bosom of the earth, a gigantic
dusky-looking figure in the human shape, inquiring his
commands.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could not come to your
assistance,&rdquo; said the object, &ldquo;till you summoned me,
or you should not have suffered so long.&nbsp; I am the mortal
foe of the Yellow Dwarf, and the legitimate prince of these
mines, into which he has intruded himself, during my absence <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>on a short
journey I made to the centre.&nbsp; He has fixed himself pretty
firmly in my palace by his spells, but I shall contrive to
dispossess him.&nbsp; I will begin by assisting you: speak,
knight of Tecklenburgh, how can I serve you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ludolph, who, recovered from his first fright, desired nothing
better, immediately struck a bargain with the friendly gnome; the
first article of which was, that he should liberate himself and
the princess.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can free you instantly,&rdquo;
replied the gnome, &ldquo;but the spells around the princess are
too powerful to be suddenly broken; nevertheless, with your help
it may finally be done.&nbsp; We must possess ourselves of the
charm in which lies the power of the Dwarf, this, unfortunately,
is his beard; for it will be a work of difficulty to master
it.&nbsp; Could you, in your combat, have cut off that, instead
of his head, all would have been well: but, as long as that beard
hangs to his chin, his body is invulnerable, for, cut him into
fifty pieces, and he will unite together again.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding all these difficulties, observe faithfully all my
directions, and, ultimately, we may accomplish our wishes.&nbsp;
Beneath those mountains of Bohemia which bound the marquisate of
Misnia, there is a diamond mine, as yet unknown to the human
race, whose sacrilegious hands have not there torn open <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>the heart of
their mother earth and disturbed the spirits who sleep in her
bosom.&nbsp; There, concealed many fathoms beneath the mountain,
has been hidden for centuries the magic weapon which alone can
conquer the Yellow Dwarf.&nbsp; It is that identical pair of
scissors with which the demon Fate cuts asunder your mortal
destinies; these, and these only, can secure our enemy.&nbsp; It
will be in vain to cut off his head so long as he retains his
beard, and that beard is unapproachable, except to the magic
scissors of fate: the chief difficulty will be in obtaining
possession of this wonderful instrument, since only a knight of
unstained loyalty, pure, spotless, free from all taint of
libertinism, drunkenness, and bloodshed, can take them from the
hands of the statue which holds them, without incurring the
severe penalty of instant death.&nbsp; When such a knight shall
be found, the scissors must be put into the hands of a spotless
virgin, for only such can use them in cutting off the formidable
beard; should any other woman attempt it, the inevitable
consequences would be also death from the scissors
themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Ludolph was as much depressed by
the end of this discourse as he had been elevated by the
beginning.&nbsp; Such a knight it was indeed next to impossible
to find.&nbsp; He himself <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>was as good and true as most; his
loyalty was indeed unstained, he had not shed blood in a
murderous or treacherous manner; but he had been too frequently
engaged in his father&rsquo;s petty, and often unjustifiable
wars, to undertake an enterprise that demanded hands free from
stain.&nbsp; Then, as for drunkenness, alas! for poor Ludolph,
though naturally a very sober man, he knew he had too often
shared many a &ldquo;t&rsquo;other flask,&rdquo; and too
frequently drowned his fears of the abbot of Fulda in the big
bowl of Tecklenburgh, to permit him any chance of success in the
achievement.&nbsp; In his own person, therefore, he gave it
directly up, satisfied of his incapacity from the fore-mentioned
weaknesses, without carrying his self-examination any further,
but at the same time almost despairing of finding a
substitute.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the spotless virgin, friendly
gnome,&rdquo; said the honest Westphalian, &ldquo;there I have
better hopes, since there are enough at court, and I shall find
this part of my task easy enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not quite
so easy as you imagine, knight,&rdquo; replied the gnome,
&ldquo;since there is not an unmarried lady in all Thuringia who
will not lay claim to that honour, and you may thus be the
innocent cause of the death of many; but I can assist you here,
and make this part of the undertaking much less difficult.&nbsp;
Here <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>is a
magic girdle; obtain permission to try it, without speaking of
its virtues, upon the ladies of the margrave&rsquo;s court.&nbsp;
Should the dame who shall buckle it on be a deceiver, the girdle,
though now appearing of a large size, will shrink into the
smallest compass, and will not even encircle her slender waist:
should the lady be the object of your search, it will set closely
and gracefully to her form.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A thousand
thanks,&rdquo; replied the honest knight; &ldquo;I have no fears
for my success in this point, and perhaps I may be more fortunate
than I expect in the other.&nbsp; Now then, generous friend,
accomplish your kind intention, release me from this dungeon, and
I will immediately hasten to Eisenac and seek a maiden who may
assist to break these abominable enchantments.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied the spirit, &ldquo;but do not
forget that to other eyes as well as Brunilda&rsquo;s, you still
wear the form of the Yellow Dwarf; this is occasioned by three
orange-coloured hairs, from his formidable beard, tied round your
right arm; unloose them, and you will appear to others as you do
to yourself and me.&nbsp; Be under no alarm for the safety of the
princess, since I have already prevented your enemy&rsquo;s
entering her presence without her permission, and will still
continue to watch over <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>her.&rdquo;&nbsp; The knight again
thanked the gnome for his friendly care, and shutting his eyes,
by command of his companion, and opening them again the next
instant, found himself, to his infinite joy, standing near the
Orange Tree, round which his horse was quietly grazing.&nbsp; He
soon sprang lightly into his saddle, and turned his head from the
wood, determined to reach Eisenac ere daybreak.&nbsp; With this
resolution he spurred on gaily, thinking of the joy he should
feel upon liberating his beloved Brunilda, when, in a turn of the
wood, he suddenly encountered a troop of knights in the livery of
the Yellow Dwarf.&nbsp; A cold shivering seized him, for he
expected to be dragged back again neck and heels to the Orange
Tree, when, to his utter astonishment, they all lowly saluted and
respectfully made way for him to pass.&nbsp; He now remembered
that he had not yet removed the orange-coloured hairs from his
arm, and, feeling himself indebted to this circumstance for his
safety, resolved to let them remain till he should be quite out
of the infernal forest.&nbsp; Dwelling fondly upon his hopes and
brightening prospects, the young morning sun found him entering
Eisenac, where he was greeted with a loud shout by a troop of
boys, who seemed to recognise an old acquaintance.&nbsp; Soon the
boy crowd was augmented <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>by a multitude of citizens, who
surrounded Ludolph, yelling like fiends, seized his bridle,
pinioned his arms, and saluted him with a volley of dreadful
curses.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorcerer, robber, demon!&rdquo; rung in his
ears in all directions, and, while the uproar raged in its
greatest violence, he was dragged from his horse, and thrown on
the ground.&nbsp; At this extraordinary treatment, the count
demanded to be conducted to the margrave, to the princess
Margaret.&nbsp; He was told that the court had quitted Eisenac,
but they were resolved to burn him alive in revenge for his
treatment of their beloved princess, and the noble count Ludolph,
her destined husband.&nbsp; Solomon said, that &ldquo;fear is
nothing else than a betraying the succours which reason
offereth;&rdquo; and, in this case, it was most truly so, for the
knight&rsquo;s agitation, in the first part of the attack, had
made him forget in time to remove the orange-coloured hairs from
his arm.&nbsp; Their last exclamation had shewn him their
mistake, and his own fatal imprudence.&nbsp; Now he found that he
was in danger of being burnt alive for the sins of the execrable
Dwarf, unless he could immediately free himself from the
charm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hear me, dear friends,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;I am truly the unhappy Ludolph, but your eyes are
bewitched by the sorceries of that abominable <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>demon, and
you see me only under his resemblance; release my arms for one
moment, and I will convince you.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this insult to
their understandings, the wise men of Eisenac set up a most
tremendous howl, and were still more anxious to collect faggots
for his service.&nbsp; They kicked, buffeted, and reviled his
person till he was almost delirious with rage, and the foamings
of his indignation confirmed them in their belief that he really
was, what he appeared, the demon of the Orange Tree.&nbsp; During
one of the pauses made by his guards to listen to his earnest
entreaties for a moment&rsquo;s liberty, he found means to
disengage his hands from their grasp, tore open his sleeve, and
furiously rending away the slight bandage of hair, stood before
them in his own proper person.&nbsp; Astonishment for a moment
tied up the tongues of the assembly, but quickly recovering
themselves before Ludolph could gain time to explain, they
declared it a new piece of sorcery, and swore that the form of
their gallant favourite should not shield the wizard who they
firmly believed was his murderer.&nbsp; The magistrates and
officers of Eisenac, aroused by the news of the seizure of the
demon Dwarf, had assembled upon the spot, and startled by the
wonders they now heard, trembled to think of the <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>consequences
of the unbridled fury of the mob, should the story told by the
equivocal knight be really true.&nbsp; Anxious to avoid the
spilling of innocent blood, they proposed conveying him to
prison, and awaiting the decision of the margrave; but the people
anticipated a sight, and rather than lose so excellent a joke as
that of roasting a sorcerer, they would willingly have run the
hazard of sacrificing even Ludolph himself.&nbsp; But the
magistrates, much to their honour, continued firm, and, through
their interference, poor Ludolph, who already felt the flames
crackling under him, with much difficulty obtained permission to
say a few words to them in his defence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Noble
magistrates and discerning judges,&rdquo; said the mob-hunted
count of Tecklenburgh, &ldquo;I trust that you will believe that
I am really myself, as I declare to you by my knighthood I
am.&nbsp; As for the Yellow Dwarf, a curse on him, I am his
victim, not his ally; since it is from his infernal enchantments,
and still more infernal malice, all my misfortunes have
arisen.&nbsp; How you can for a moment imagine that I could be
his friend because I have been unlucky enough to appear under his
odious form, I am at a loss to imagine, since nobody surely can
possibly believe such a transformation to be a matter of
choice.&rdquo;&nbsp; The female part of the audience <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>perfectly
agreed with this last observation of Ludolph, and the
magistrates, puzzled by the sincerity with which he had delivered
his remonstrance, determined to save him, at least from the fire
and the faggots.&nbsp; But, as the people had expected a show,
thought the wise men of Eisenac, &ldquo;a show they must
have,&rdquo; or the consequences, they knew, of their
disappointment in an affair so essential to their well-being,
might not be entirely insignificant to their betters.&nbsp; So,
while acquitting him, in their consciences, of being the Yellow
Dwarf, and forbidding the animating use of fire and faggots, they
condemned him to be put to the ban, as a nobleman, for dabbling
in a little private sorcery in conjunction with the demon, in
whose villainous shape he had just appeared.&nbsp; No sooner was
this righteous sentence pronounced against the unlucky Ludolph,
than he was seized by the soldiers and followed by all the crowd,
who, anxious to join in the fun, exhibited many a practical
witticism at his expense, and cracked all their superfluous jokes
upon his unfortunate person: then stripping him of his armour and
knightly accoutrements, and clothing him in raw and filthy
goatskins, they set him upon a sorry mule with his face towards
the tail, and led him through the town, <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>the herald
proclaiming before him, &ldquo;We declare thy wife, if thou hast
one, a widow, thy children, if thou hast any, orphans, and we
send thee, in the name of the devil, to the four corners of the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus sent upon a long voyage, with such a
friendly benediction, it would not have been wonderful if the
heart of the knight had sunk with his circumstances, which any
heart would have done except a Westphalian one, but that was
employed in swelling with indignation, and meditating the best
mode of returning the compliments of the Eisenac nobility.&nbsp;
While thus occupied, he heard a voice close to his ear, which
whispered, &ldquo;Attend to my orders, and you are
safe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked earnestly in the direction of the
sound, and saw, to his infinite satisfaction, the dusky face of
his friend the gnome beneath the helmet of a soldier.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let these people continue to believe you the Yellow
Dwarf,&rdquo; continued the spirit; &ldquo;it is the only way to
preserve you from suspicion in your real character; here are the
hairs which, in your haste, you threw away.&nbsp; Resist not
while I tie them round your arm, and leave the rest to
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ludolph sat silent while, under the appearance
of a new insult, his instructor twisted the light band round his
arm, and the shrieks of the people a moment after announced <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>that the
charm had taken effect upon their senses.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the
sorcerer,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;the horrible
Dwarf&mdash;seize him, tear him, burn him!&rdquo;&nbsp; But, for
this time, their kind intentions were completely frustrated, for
the gnome, entering into the sorry mule which carried the
prisoner, communicated to his worn-out frame such inconceivable
vigour and rapidity, that a few minutes were sufficient to bear
his rider far beyond the pursuit of his enemies, who remained in
the market-place, staring after the beast and cursing the Yellow
Dwarf.&nbsp; The representative of that malignant little demon
was meanwhile receiving a few drops of a powerful cordial from
the hands of his friend the gnome of the mine, who politely
apologised for not knowing earlier the mischiefs into which his
dear crony had fallen,&mdash;owing, however, entirely to his own
excessive carelessness, which he should never have
suspected.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, in truth,&rdquo; continued the
friendly spirit, &ldquo;I concluded you were safe at the
margrave&rsquo;s court which is at Weimar, and whither I had
intended to follow you.&nbsp; Passing over Eisenac, I rested to
know the meaning of the tumult I witnessed, and was just in time
to rescue you from the rage of the mob, who would not have
quitted their prey, even after the soldiers should have set <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>you at
liberty.&nbsp; Here,&rdquo; continued the gnome, giving him a
heavy bag of coin, a most welcome present to a half-naked knight
errant, &ldquo;hasten to equip yourself according to your rank,
and lose no time in joining the court at Weimar, where you must
select a damsel to conclude the adventure ere Brunilda can
recover her liberty, or you be freed from the malice of the
Yellow Dwarf.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ludolph heartily thanked his good
friend, though he could not help thinking it would have been as
well if his assistance had been tendered some few hours
earlier.&nbsp; But still, better late than never, thought the
knight; and, though he had received a few cuffs and many bitter
curses, yet hard words break no bones, and the cuffs he hoped one
day to repay with interest.&nbsp; In the interim his honour was
preserved by the contrivance of the gnome, as no man in Eisenac,
no, not even the sapient magistrates themselves, would ever
believe the creature they had pounded and worried so
unmercifully, was any other than the Yellow Dwarf himself.&nbsp;
Receiving from his hands once more the magic girdle which he had
lost in the confusion, he bade farewell to the gnome, who
promised to meet him in the forest, when he should have obtained
the magic scissors, upon which their success depended; and, after
accoutring <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>himself as became his condition, not this time
forgetting the three red hairs, he set forward once more for the
court of the margrave; and, as he was by no means of a melancholy
complexion, his past misfortunes had no other effect upon his
spirits than elevating them to a joyous pitch for glee, that he
had so well escaped the dangers which he believed would have
ended more tragically.&nbsp; And thus gay, and hoping much from
the future, he arrived, without any further adventure, at the
palace of Weimar.</p>
<h3><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<blockquote><p>Ane gat a twist o&rsquo; the craig,<br />

And syne he went bellowing hame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> princess Margaret was overjoyed
once more to see her Brunilda&rsquo;s lover, and she welcomed him
with the sincerest regard.&nbsp; She listened with burning
indignation to the account of the Dwarf&rsquo;s treatment of his
captives, and to such other parts of his history as he thought
proper to relate; for he carefully suppressed, in the presence of
the court, his adventures at Eisenac and his release by the
gnome, lest the friendship of this good-natured spirit should
again subject him to the charge of sorcery; and as he had already
smelt fire at Eisenac, he was particularly anxious to avoid so
warm a reception elsewhere.&nbsp; He informed the good princess
that the girdle would only fit the damsel appointed by destiny to
break the enchantment, and of consequence all were anxious to try
it.&nbsp; Three of the most beautiful ladies in <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Misnia
attempted, but, strange to relate, in vain, to fix on the magic
cestus: it shrunk to nothing round their forms, and Ludolph began
again to tremble for the fate of his poor Brunilda.&nbsp; In vain
did the most prudish ladies of the court present their slim forms
to the girdle,&mdash;it would not meet around them.&nbsp; Several
of those who had been most rigid in their own conduct, and most
bitterly virtuous in regard to that of others, took the girdle
with a devout air and a blushing modesty, that quite revived the
hope of the Westphalian knight.&nbsp; Alas! the cestus not only
refused to clasp the waists of these fair ones, but even flew
right out of their hands the moment they touched it; and this
circumstance so disheartened Ludolph, that he foolishly enough,
ere above twenty ladies had made the attempt, gossiped out the
secret of its virtues in the delighted ear of the princess
Margaret.&nbsp; That good lady thought the joke too excellent to
be confined to so few persons; and there being among the unlucky
twenty some whose beauty rivalled that of her beloved Brunilda,
she lost no time in publishing the secret, which had all the
effect of making them abhor Ludolph, and defeating the plans he
was so anxious to carry into effect; for now, not a single woman
acquainted with the <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>virtue of the cestus would even try
it on, and, instead of laughing with the princess and Ludolph at
the unlucky discoveries made by the twenty, they made, much to
their honour, common cause against them, and vowed to smother the
mischievous knight whenever they could conveniently catch hold of
him.&nbsp; It required all the authority of the margrave, who at
this juncture arrived at Weimar from the camp, to protect the
unfortunate knight from their vengeance, who began to be as much
afraid of these beautiful destroying angels as he had been of the
fire-loving devils of Eisenac, or even the Yellow Dwarf
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas! I am surely the most unfortunate of
men,&rdquo; said he to the margrave; &ldquo;I have been
transformed to the detested shape of the Yellow Dwarf, for
wishing to deliver your sister out of his hands.&nbsp; I have
been very near roasting alive for killing myself.&nbsp; I have
been put to the ban for suffering myself to be tormented by my
powerful enemy, and now I am in danger of being torn to pieces by
the loveliest women in the world, only for being anxious to find
one virgin in their company.&nbsp; Ah, my poor Brunilda! what
will become of thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; The margrave comforted the
knight with the assurance that he would certainly be successful,
if he could but prevail upon the <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>ladies only to try on the girdle,
and, in case of their obstinacy, he advised him to put the magic
scissors into the hands of Brunilda herself, &ldquo;For, if she
be not worthy to use them,&rdquo; said the proud Frederic with
the bitten cheek, &ldquo;she is not worthy of liberty, nor the
tender love you bear her.&nbsp; For the other conditions, I fear
we must despair, since I do not believe there is a knight in my
court, no, nor in all the courts of Germany, that will venture to
accept the challenge; though, against mortal foes, they are the
bravest men in the universe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The margrave was
right.&nbsp; Each knight knew his own secret weaknesses too well
to accept the office, when the conditions were stated to them, no
one being willing, as they honestly avowed, to hazard an
ignominious death, by disregarding the injunctions of the
gnome.&nbsp; There was not a man among them who had not, at some
time or other, offended by drunkenness, licentiousness, or
breaking heads in an unjust quarrel: indeed, with regard to the
latter peccadillo, it was scarcely possible, in the time of which
I am treating, for it to be otherwise, since not only disputes of
chivalry, and all injuries, whether public or private, were
settled by the sword, but even cases of felony and suits of law
were arranged by the same expeditious decision; <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>so that he
of the strongest arm and stoutest heart infallibly gained his
cause, whether right or wrong, as his adversary could no longer
contend, either for reputation or property, after the dagger of
mercy had been struck into his heart, or drawn quietly across his
throat.</p>
<p>But, to return to our good Westphalian and his
difficulties.&nbsp; After many objections, disputings, hopings,
and fearings, the margrave at last found a salvo for Ludolph, and
a stainless knight for the service of the king of the
oranges.&nbsp; This was his own son, a boy of ten years old, upon
whom, finding all other hope fail, he conferred the honour of
knighthood, and released him from his martial studies, in which
the gallant child spent all his time, and sent him to handle the
shears of Atropus, and share in the glory of shaving the
orange-coloured beard of the execrable Dwarf.&nbsp; The little
knight Herman of Misnia was highly delighted by his admittance to
this post of honour, and attached himself fondly to his good
cousin Ludolph, who now began making preparations for his
march.&nbsp; So great was the terror inspired among the people by
the Yellow Dwarf, that it was with much difficulty he could
collect troops sufficient to defend the son of the margrave upon
this voyage of discovery, as all the nobles, <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>knights,
and regulars of Thuringia, were gone to the camp in daily
expectation of an attack from the emperor Albert, who, having
been just overreached in his views upon Bohemia, by his good
cousin Henry of Carinthia, was advancing in no very good humour
upon the troops of the margrave of Misnia.&nbsp; After a
proclamation of some days, in which Ludolph puffed the vast
riches of the diamond mine with almost as much skill as Day and
Martin puff their blacking, a number of strays from all parts of
the empire gathered themselves together under his standard; and
though he could not boast of commanding many of the nobles of
Misnia, yet, upon the whole, his troop was about as respectable
as David&rsquo;s at the cave of Adullam, when only those who were
in debt, or distress, or discontented, enrolled themselves in his
service.&nbsp; But great endings spring from small
beginnings.&nbsp; From a captain of half-starved ragamuffins
David became a king; and Ludolph hoped that his regiment of black
guards would finally conduct him to the feet of a princess.&nbsp;
With this notion he set forward, full of expectation, with the
youthful knight committed to his charge.&nbsp; On their road,
fearful of any other delays, he inspirited his companions by
dwelling, with affected rapture, upon the spoils of the diamonds,
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>which
were so soon to be at their service, in the sack of the
mine.&nbsp; These observations acted like electricity upon his
respectable warriors, and sent them galloping towards the
confines so rapidly, that before he had either hoped or expected
it, they had arrived at the foot of the mystic mountain, where
the whole troop made a halt, to await the return of Ludolph, who,
with his young companion, was to descend first into the caves,
seize the scissors, and then leave the coast clear for the
plunderers to attack the mine.&nbsp; Matters were soon
settled.&nbsp; The two knights found the entrance with some
difficulty, and boldly descended into these dismal abodes, the
residence of the infernal spirits who were in the pay of the
Yellow Dwarf.&nbsp; After traversing many dreary caverns, they
entered the last, where, elevated on a golden pedestal, stood the
gigantic statue which held the scissors of fate, and was the
guardian of the life of the Yellow Dwarf.&nbsp; Forgetting, in
his joy at the sight, the caution of the gnome, he was advancing
towards the statue, when a tremendous box on the ear from the
marble fist taught him to know his distance.&nbsp; He fell back
accordingly, and, young Herman of Misnia approaching, the statue
grinned as hideously as his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, but made no
attempt to injure the boy, <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>as fearlessly he climbed the
pedestal, and, without any regard to the rights of property,
grasped the magic scissors, and brought them away in
triumph.&nbsp; Ludolph received them from his hands with the
wildest sensation of delight; but, prudence conquering his
emotions, he took his young preserver in his arms and retraced
his way to daylight.&nbsp; Here he was greeted with shouts of
applause by the soldiers, who, in spite of the entreaties of
Ludolph, persisted to ransack the caves, pursuant to their
original agreement.&nbsp; In vain did he assure them the
margrave&rsquo;s enemies would furnish more spoils for them than
the vaults, and that his share should be divided among
them.&nbsp; Vainly did he describe the threatening looks of the
statue, and assure them he still felt the tingling of the marble
thump in his ear, with which it had complimented him.&nbsp; It
was talking to the winds, or, as old Baker quaintly saith,
&ldquo;to as little purpose as if he had gone about to call back
yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; Down they all dashed together, neck and
heels, with tremendous outcries, into the diamond caverns.&nbsp;
But their return was silent and orderly enough.&nbsp; The cave of
Trophonius could not have effected a better or more expeditious
change.&nbsp; They were all as grave as judges, and every man
appeared with his <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>mouth twisted exactly under his left ear.&nbsp; Ludolph
could gain but little information as to what had befallen them;
all he understood was, that they had seen the statue, who had
given the first man such a thundering slap of the face that its
shock was felt by all the rest of his companions, and left the
consequences which he now beheld, and which they had such good
reasons to deplore.&nbsp; But, while the knights of the scissors
and their wry-mouthed confederates are pursuing their road to
Weimar, let us pop our heads under ground and see what has become
of Brunilda.</p>
<p>The poor princess, much disconcerted by the diabolical
contrivance of the Yellow Dwarf, gave way, when alone, to that
indulgence of grief which she resolutely suppressed in his
presence.&nbsp; She had encouraged the visits of the two Dwarfs,
in the tender hope that, though they afforded no consolation to
herself, they might yield some satisfaction to the bosom of her
tormented lover.&nbsp; This being the real state of her feelings,
she was deeply distressed when, the day after Ludolph&rsquo;s
release by the gnome, they neglected to pay her the customary
visit, and therefore sent to request the presence of her
tyrant.&nbsp; He came, and in no very good humour, for he had
just failed in the effect of a spell, which he hoped would
discover <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>the runaway.&nbsp; He told her, even more brutally than
usual, that Ludolph had escaped, that he was endeavouring to
discover him, and that, in case he succeeded, of which he had no
doubt, he would immediately hang him, unless the princess would
save his life by giving her hand to his rival.&nbsp; Delighted by
the escape of the knight, Brunilda could not keep her joy to
herself, but expressed it so imprudently, and with such heartfelt
glee at the Dwarf&rsquo;s vexation, that it irritated all the
bile in his little yellow body, and provoked him to have recourse
to his most powerful spells to discover the abode of
Ludolph.&nbsp; It was, luckily for the knight, a work of time and
difficulty, since the gnome of the mine was at hand to unravel
all his charms as fast as the other wrought them; and he was, by
this means, obliged to desist, in order to find the invisible
enemy who thus thwarted his plans and protected his victim.&nbsp;
The indefatigable gnome was still at his elbow, and poor
yellow-beard continued as much in the dark at the end of his
spells, as he had been at the beginning.&nbsp; All this gave the
knight time, which was what the gnome wanted, and the Dwarf
remained in ignorance of his movements, till the spirits, who
were the guardians of his talisman in the mountain caves,
informed <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>him of his danger and the seizure of the magic
scissors.&nbsp; Such a contrivance as that of knighting a child
the demon had never contemplated, but finding one half of the
adventure accomplished, he determined, as far as in him lay, to
prevent the achievement of the other.&nbsp; Learning by his
fiends, that he was threatened with danger from Brunilda, he made
it his principal care that the magic scissors should not be
wielded by her, and accordingly penned her up more closely than
ever, surrounding her by spells, not only inaccessible to
mortals, but even to his own attendant spirits, whom he would not
trust too far, lest his tyranny should have inspired them with
hatred to his person, and laxity in his service.&nbsp; Among his
equals in the demon world he well knew, and feared the
indignation of the gnome of the silver mines, whose territories
he had invaded, and before whose power, if joined to that of
other enemies, he would have good reasons to tremble.&nbsp; These
considerations determined his conduct, and, to prevent Brunilda
from handling the scissors, and the scissors from approaching his
beard, he devised a spell so potent, that he fondly hoped and
believed he was safe from the attacks of, and might bid defiance
to, all sorts of enemies, natural and supernatural.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>In
the mean time, Ludolph and his companions had arrived at the
court of Weimar, to the great joy of the margrave and his mother,
who, looking upon the adventure as nearly finished, entreated
Ludolph to lose no time in joining his friend the gnome in the
enchanted forest.&nbsp; He himself had no wish to delay the
business, and, after making one more unsuccessful attempt to
prevail upon the ladies of Misnia to try on the girdle, he set
off to present it to his lovely Brunilda; and, arriving near the
Orange Tree, was met by the friendly gnome.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
not yet in my power to introduce you to the presence of the
princess,&rdquo; said he to the count, &ldquo;as I have not yet
conquered the spells by which our enemy has surrounded her: the
cavern is inaccessible at present to any human foot, but it is
not in the power of the demon to limit my steps in the territory
of which I am the legitimate lord.&nbsp; His spirits are as
powerful as mine, and thus I am obliged to have recourse to
artifice to conquer him, which I should not be able to effect, if
he had not, by obtruding into my dominions, placed the secret of
his spells in my power.&nbsp; Unlike the free spirits who have
existed from the beginning of the world, and who will probably
survive its demolition, the Dwarf is mortal born, though, by <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>magic
spells, he has lengthened his life many hundred years; but his
birth subjects him to death, which will be inevitable, should the
infernal power by which he has accomplished his purposes be
defeated.&nbsp; To prevent this catastrophe, he has placed his
life in a talisman, which he believes unconquerable, but which, I
trust, we shall overthrow.&nbsp; Caution is, however, necessary,
for his spells are mighty, and the spirits subjected to his
command are many.&nbsp; In the interim you shall rest here, and I
will provide for your necessities till I shall be able to conduct
you to Brunilda, to whom you must explain the virtues of the
scissors of fate, for, by an immutable decree which no spirit
dares violate, I am restrained from appearing before her till she
herself shall summon me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gnome then raised a
comfortable tent for Ludolph, loaded it with provisions, drew a
line of protection about it, and vanished.</p>
<p>Three days passed tranquilly enough with Ludolph, while
patiently awaiting the re-appearance of his friend the gnome, but
the fourth was beginning to hang very heavy, when the spirit
entered the tent in the middle of the night.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
triumph,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I have unloosed the spell that
kept you from the presence of Brunilda.&nbsp; <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>The Dwarf,
being mortal born, is subject to mortal necessities, and at this
hour he sleeps; rise and throw yourself at the feet of the
princess; give me your hand, and close your eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ludolph obeyed, and the next moment found himself in the
apartment of Brunilda.&nbsp; As I, the honest chronicler of the
loves of the Westphalian knight and Misnian princess, am no great
dealer in sentiment, I shall omit all the particulars of the
meeting, and only say how truly happy Brunilda was to receive
him, and how grateful she felt towards the obliging gnome, whom
she gladly summoned to her presence.&nbsp; To the great relief of
Ludolph, who trembled and doubted grievously while making the
proposal, she had not the slightest objection, even after she was
made acquainted with its virtues, to try on the enchanted girdle,
which fitted her graceful form as if it had been purposely made
for her: her lover could not help commending the taste of the
Yellow Dwarf, and was as much overjoyed at this earnest of
success as if he already held the demon&rsquo;s beard in his
hand.&nbsp; The gnome then gave Brunilda the fatal scissors, and
telling them that the spirits of their enemy could not perceive
them, from the powerful spells by which they were surrounded,
desired them to follow his footsteps fearlessly to the inner <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>caverns,
where slept the demon, and whom sleep would probably render
defenceless.&nbsp; Stretching out their necks and stepping on
tiptoe, the lovers followed the gnome to the private apartment of
the Dwarf, whom Brunilda anxiously hoped to serve in quality of
barber extraordinary.&nbsp; With beating hearts they beheld their
guide throw open the door of his chamber, and desire the princess
to advance, at the same time approaching the couch of the demon,
and drawing back his curtain.&nbsp; Brunilda obeyed; mustering
all her courage, and collecting a little army of disagreeable
remembrances to her aid, she found herself so strengthened that,
like Judith, she resolved to finish the business with a single
snip.&nbsp; But the Holofernes of Germany had had more wit than
his drunken predecessor, and had taken much better care of his
shaggy head; for the Judith of Misnia looked in vain for the
yellow beard that was to fall beneath the fatal scissors.&nbsp;
That <i>that</i> had disappeared was not wonderful, since the
face to which it formed such a remarkable appendage had entirely
vanished from the body.&nbsp; There lay the carcase of the Dwarf,
sleeping, it might be, but his head was dozing in some other
place, for the body was very quietly reposing without it.&nbsp;
Poor Brunilda shed tears of vexation, and the <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>gnome
looked silly enough to find himself thus completely outwitted;
but knowing that he could find no remedy for the disappointment
by standing gaping at the demon&rsquo;s trunk, he drew the lovers
from the chamber, conducted Ludolph back to his tent, and again
had recourse to his spells, which told him that the Dwarf,
fearful of surprise while disarmed by sleep, took off his head
every night, and concealed it in some place of safety, but where
he could not discover.&nbsp; This was a vexatious incident; but
&ldquo;<i>ruse contre ruse</i>,&rdquo; thought the gnome, and to
work he went with a fresh resolution to outspell the yellow
conjuror and liberate the lovers.&nbsp; In the mean time the
demon awoke from his invigorating slumber, and hastened to
replace his ugly head upon his shoulders, and then, head and tail
once more united, sat down to consider the possibility of
recapturing the knight of Tecklenburgh, in whose hands,
notwithstanding the success of his spells, he did not like to
leave the magic scissors.&nbsp; Brunilda, it is true, was safe
enough; but the Dwarf knew (though Ludolph could not discover
them) that there were more virgins than one in the Misnian court;
and that the count wanted neither eloquence to persuade such to
assist him, nor resolution to attack his enemy, when that
difficulty should be <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>conquered.&nbsp; In the midst of
these cogitations he was aroused by a summons from the princess,
who had not permitted him to approach her since the day after
Ludolph&rsquo;s departure: the little coxcomb was enchanted by
the message, and hastened to arrange his looks in the most
becoming manner possible, ere he presented himself before the
eyes of his lovely captive.&nbsp; Brunilda was in tears when he
entered her apartment, and no sooner did she behold him than she
poured upon him such a torrent of reproach and abuse, that the
Dwarf, though in general tolerably well skilled in the use of
that cutting weapon the tongue, stood utterly confounded, and
knew not what to reply.&nbsp; She accused him vehemently of the
murder of her lover, her dear Ludolph, which secret, she said,
had been revealed to her in a dream by her patron saint that very
night, and she had therefore sent for him to accuse him to his
guilty face.&nbsp; The Dwarf listened in surprise; but this time,
far from retorting with his usual bitterness upon Brunilda, he
was hugging himself in the notion that the patron saint might
have told the truth, and that Ludolph, whom all his arts had
failed to discover, might really be no longer an inhabitant of
the earth, in which case he flattered himself he might possibly
succeed him in the affections of the fair <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Brunilda,
whose hand he coveted no less than her brother&rsquo;s lands, of
which he resolved to dispossess him whenever he should become the
husband of his sister.&nbsp; Full of these agreeable hopes and
ideas, he soothed the weeping princess as well as the ruggedness
of his nature would permit, and assured her, that though her
lover was dead, (a circumstance of which he averred he was well
aware, though compassion had hitherto prevented his informing
her,) yet he had no hand in his death, and would endeavour by
every mark of tenderness and attention to reconcile her to this
inevitable loss.&nbsp; Brunilda suffered herself to be comforted,
and even allowed his yellow lips to press her fair hand, which so
delighted the lover, that he released her from her severe
confinement, and permitted her to roam at large through the
caverns, and occupy her former apartment, where he continued to
visit her daily, and daily quitted her with the flattering hope
that he had at length discovered the mode of making himself
agreeable.&nbsp; Brunilda encouraged this delightful dream by her
changed method of conduct; she ceased, after the first two
interviews, entirely to reproach the Dwarf, and permitted his
attentions without any ill humour.&nbsp; From permitting his
devotions, she gradually appeared to desire them, and even
frequently condescended to rally him upon the <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>oddity of
his dress, and the old-fashioned cut of his hood: he immediately
adopted another to gratify her taste, and was exceedingly vain of
the notice she took of him.&nbsp; She admired his flowing hair,
and even his long beard had ceased to be an object of disgust to
her: every thing became beautiful by custom, she said; and she
now discovered, what her indignation before had prevented her
from observing, that the colour of his beard was the same as that
of her great grandfather the emperor Frederic II., who was
universally accounted a very handsome man.&nbsp; The Dwarf
smirked, bridled, and was equally delighted with Brunilda and
himself, since he now hoped no further opposition on her part
would be offered to his proposals: he grew excessively fond of,
and very indulgent to the princess, suffering her to command in
his caverns, and taking great delight in exhibiting to her the
riches of which she was so soon to be the mistress.&nbsp; In all
ages, among all nations, flattery has ever been the shortest and
the surest road to the human heart; and men, however they may
affect to smile at this weakness in the gentler sex, are not,
whether giants, middle-sized men, or dwarfs, one whit less
subject to this poor human frailty than the ladies themselves, in
whom it is <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>so pardonable.&nbsp; If Eve yielded to the compliments
of the serpent, Sampson was subdued by the witching coaxing of
Dalilah; the sage Solomon drank flattery from the lips of seven
hundred wives (Heaven pardon the old monopoliser!) and three
hundred concubines; Holofernes lost his head for listening to the
seducing tongue of Judith; and the mighty Nebuchadnezzar was not
sent to grass for any other reason than swallowing down too
plentiful a dose of this bewitching opiate: of all these
gentlefolks, Eve was certainly least blameable; for it required
diabolical power to turn her from the path of right, but the men
sunk their virtue before the lustre of black eyes or the
gorgeousness of costly attire.&nbsp; As for profane story&mdash;O
the tens and the fifties that might be enumerated!&mdash;but as
this is not our present business, let us leave them to see what
effect this pleasant medicine, so gently administered, had upon
the mind of the little Dwarf.&nbsp; He was, in truth, the
happiest of all yellow men; for, deceived by the tranquillity of
his life and the strength of his spells, he believed his enemy
had given up the task of conquering him, and left him to wear his
beard in quiet.&nbsp; Brunilda still continued amiable, and heard
him frequently, without any marks of indignation, express his
hope that, when the time <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>of her sorrowful mourning for the
count of Tecklenburgh should be over, she would listen with
compassion to the sufferings of a truer lover.&nbsp; She neither
checked nor encouraged these expectations; and the happy demon
determined not to forfeit her affection by any precipitation on
his part.&nbsp; All this amiable conduct, however, on the part of
Brunilda, was, in fact, but a contrivance of the friendly gnome,
who thus hoped to extort by her means the secret of his nightly
pillow from himself.&nbsp; According to the plan agreed upon by
the allies, the gnome, at this period of his enemy&rsquo;s
courtship, began again to disturb and puzzle him by his
enchantments; and he succeeded in discomposing the harmony of his
feelings so much, that he was obliged to have recourse to
Brunilda, and (secure of her attachment to his person) vent all
his complaints and vexations in her compassionating bosom.&nbsp;
<i>She</i> was all astonishment at the cruel designs projected
against her Dwarf by his ungenerous enemies; she implored him
pathetically to take care of his head, (a request with which he
graciously promised to comply, more for her sake than his own,)
and exhibited such anxiety to know if his precautions were
sufficient, that the Dwarf almost betrayed his secret, overcome
by the excessive vanity her conduct was so <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>well
calculated to inspire.&nbsp; Relaxing from his habitual caution,
he was about to inform her of some arrangements of his spells,
when Brunilda, overacting the part assigned to her, entreated
him, if he valued her happiness, to commit his precious head
every night to her keeping, promising to guard it with her utmost
tenderness and care.&nbsp; At this imprudent request, all his
suspicions returned; he eyed Brunilda askance, and gravely told
her that, even were she his bride, he could not grant her desire,
as it had always been his opinion that the less wives were
trusted with the care of their husbands&rsquo; heads the
better.&nbsp; He left her surlily: he had himself told her of his
headless rest, but he did not expect such a request would follow
his information; and Brunilda, alarmed by the consequences of her
ill-timed petition, summoned the gnome of the mine to her
presence.&nbsp; He chid her precipitation, but gave her a small
vial containing a delicious cordial, which should repair the
mischief.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may have observed,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that the Dwarf neither eats nor drinks of your food:
prevail upon him once to sup at your table, and pour a few drops
of this cordial into his drink: he must take it willingly, or it
will have no effect.&nbsp; In the sleep which follows the
enchanted draught, he will be partly <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>in my power, and compelled to answer
any question you may propose to him.&nbsp; I need not direct you
what to ask; but should he reply according to our wishes, summon
me to your side, and the business is done.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gnome
gave her the potion, and vanished; while Brunilda diligently
applied herself to remove the suspicions of the Dwarf.&nbsp; In a
few days she completely succeeded; and the flattered demon, on
hearing her frequently complain of the insipidity of supping
alone, requested permission to attend her at table during her
supper.&nbsp; This request was readily granted, and the visit
constantly repeated by the Dwarf, who at length, at her earnest
entreaty, consented to partake of her repast.&nbsp; This was
continued till all suspicion was removed from the mind of the
Dwarf; and in one of his happiest moods she insisted upon his
pledging her in wine: he obeyed, and, with the contents of the
bowl, swallowed the magic cordial.&nbsp; With what anxiety did
Brunilda count the hours till she deemed the Dwarf had retired to
rest; how she trembled as she quitted her chamber for that of her
tyrant, whose beard, ere day-break, she hoped, would be the
reward of her courage!&nbsp; With a beating heart she entered his
apartment, and stepping up to him, demanded in a trembling
voice&mdash;&ldquo;Dwarf of the Orange Tree, <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>where hast
thou hidden thy head?&rdquo;&nbsp; The stubborn carcase made no
reply to this straight-forward question; and Brunilda shivered
from head to foot as she considered the possibility of his not
yet being asleep, and both hearing and understanding her
question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should it be so, I am indeed utterly
undone,&rdquo; said poor Brunilda; &ldquo;for how shall I ever be
able to deceive him again, since he must now be aware of my
motives.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another reflection brought more comfort:
she recollected, that as the head only can hear, so the head only
can answer questions; and she determined to walk quietly through
all the caverns, and repeat the question in each.&nbsp; She had
but a short time allowed her for action, as the Dwarf was an
early riser, and she lost none in putting her scheme in
execution.&nbsp; Away she sallied, quick as anxiety would allow
her; unwearied she pursued her task, but ranged through every
apartment of the subterranean palace without obtaining an
answer.&nbsp; She almost thought the Dwarf had removed his head
further off, when, passing through a dismal-looking hole in which
were two iron pillars, she paused to repeat the
charm&mdash;&ldquo;Dwarf of the Orange Tree, where hast thou
hidden thy head?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied a
well-known voice; &ldquo;here, in the pillar on your left
hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brunilda started at the <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>sound, but
quickly recovered her spirits, and turning to the east, summoned,
as agreed upon, her coadjutors to her
assistance&mdash;&ldquo;Gnome of this mine, I call thee hither:
bring with thee my lover, and the magic scissors of
fate.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the next instant her friends were at her
side, and the scissors glittered in her hand.&nbsp; She explained
in few words the happy result of her enterprise; the gnome struck
the pillar with his mace, the massy substance divided, and the
ugly head of her detested jailer rolled at the feet of the
delighted Brunilda, who, without any apology, seized it, and
began most nimbly to ply the magic scissors.&nbsp; At that
moment, the Dwarf, awakened by the near approach of morning, flew
to replace his head upon his shoulders, and discovered, with the
utmost rage and alarm, the intruders upon his premises.&nbsp; The
opened eyes of the head now directed the motions of the body,
which rushed forward and bounced upon them so suddenly, that
Brunilda shrieked and dropped the head, only retaining a grasp of
the beard.&nbsp; The Dwarf as nimbly caught it, and endeavoured
to wrest it from her; but the princess, invigorated by despair
and the exclamations of her friends, kept fast hold of it, and
struggled stoutly with the demon.&nbsp; The gnome lent her his
assistance, in holding the <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>head for her scissors, while Ludolph
kept shoving, thrusting, and hacking with his sword at the
invulnerable demon, in the hope of obliging him to loosen his
grasp of his head.&nbsp; The struggle continued some minutes, the
Dwarf pulling, Ludolph shoving, and Brunilda, utterly regardless
of the scratches he was liberally bestowing upon her lover,
cutting away at the yellow beard with all her might and
main.&nbsp; At length she observed, that the longer she cut, the
weaker grew the resistance of the demon, and this gave new force
to her delicate fingers; she snipped on till the last hair was
separated from the chin, and the yellow head and deformed body
both fell senseless together upon the ground.&nbsp; Brunilda was
quietly looking upon her fallen enemy, when the magic instrument
of her success suddenly sprung from her hand, and she beheld the
scissors of fate gliding away rapidly through the air, as if
borne off by an invisible spirit.&nbsp; The friendly gnome then
conducted the lovers to the margrave&rsquo;s court, (after
demanding from Brunilda the magic belt, which he said would be
too dangerous a weapon in the hand of a lady,) and a few weeks
after the battle of Luckow, in which the margrave was successful,
they were united, to the great joy of <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>all parties, but more particularly
of those who expected to be invited to the wedding dinner.&nbsp;
But that dinner!&nbsp; O that dinner! why what a glory of
gastronomy were the dishes!&nbsp; There was the porpoise stewed
in his own oil; beeves roasted whole; and proudly pre-eminent,
even among them, the noble wild boar, the standard dish of
Germany, showed his grinning tusks, now no longer formidable;
roasted cranes, standing upon their long legs, seemed just
stepping out of their platters, making a &ldquo;pretty
drollery;&rdquo; there was the knightly peacock, the bird of
chivalry, dressed out in his brilliant feathers; the stately
swan, sailing about in his golden dish; while herons, turkeys,
geese, and such small fry, graced the magnificent board in
quality of side dishes.&nbsp; In short, as the newspapers said,
&ldquo;there were all the delicacies of the season,&rdquo; which
the nobles washed down with floods of Rhenish, until they did not
know what they were swallowing.&nbsp; The day was happier than it
was long, for all thought its felicity was too short-lived,
except Ludolph and his princess, who had many still brighter; as
long years of happiness was the reward of their few months of
suffering.&nbsp; The gnome of the mine returned to his recovered
territories, and, as he had now no farther occasion <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>for their
services, never since that time interfered in the concerns of
mortals.&nbsp; The princess Margaret lived to a good old age, and
died at last in the odour of sanctity, eschewing evil, Satan,
sin, and the yellow Demon of the Orange Tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Listen</span>, dear wife,&rdquo;
said Bertram, the forester of Lindenhayn, to his good and
faithful Anne; &ldquo;listen, I beseech you, one moment.&nbsp;
You know I have ever done my utmost to make you happy, and will
still continue to do so; but this project is out of the
question.&nbsp; I entreat you, do not encourage the girl any
farther in the notion; settle the matter decidedly at once, and
she will only <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>drop a few silent tears, and then resign herself to my
wishes; but by these silly delays nothing rational can be
effected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dearest husband,&rdquo; objected the coaxing wife,
&ldquo;may not Catherine be as happy with William the clerk as
with Robert the gamekeeper?&nbsp; Indeed you do not know him: he
is so clever, so good, so kind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no marksman,&rdquo; interrupted the forester.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The situation which I hold here has been possessed by my
family for more than two hundred years, and has always descended
down in a straight line from father to son.&nbsp; If, instead of
this girl, Anne, you had brought me a boy, all would have been
well; he would have had my situation, and the wench, if she had
been in existence, might have chosen for her bridegroom him whom
she loved best; now the thing is impossible.&nbsp; My son-in-law
must also be my successor, and must therefore be a
marksman.&nbsp; I shall have, in the first place, some trouble to
obtain the trial for him; and in the second, if he should not
succeed, truly, I shall have thrown my girl away: so a clever
huntsman she shall have.&nbsp; But observe, if you do not like
him, I do not exactly insist upon Robert: find another active
clever fellow for the girl, I will resign my situation <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>to him, and
we shall pass the rest of our lives free from anxiety and happily
with our children.&nbsp; But hush!&mdash;not another
word!&mdash;I beseech you let me hear no more of the
steward&rsquo;s clerk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother Anne was silenced; she would fain have said a few more
words in favour of poor William, but the forester, who was too
well acquainted with the power of female persuasion, gave her no
further opportunity; he took down his gun, whistled his dog, and
strode away to the forest.&nbsp; The next moment, the fair curled
head of Catherine, her face radiant with smiles, was popped in at
the door&mdash;&ldquo;Is all right, dear mother?&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas! no, my child; do not rejoice too
soon;&rdquo; replied the sorrowing Anne.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your father
speaks kindly, but he has determined to give you to nobody but a
huntsman; and I know he will not change his mind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Catherine wept, and declared she would sooner die than wed any
other than her own William.&nbsp; Her mother wept, fretted, and
scolded by turns; till at length it was finally determined to
make another grand attack upon the tough heart of old Bertram;
and, in the midst of a deliberation respecting the manner in
which this was to be effected, the rejected lover entered the
apartment.</p>
<p>When William had heard the cause of the <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>forester&rsquo;s objection,&mdash;&ldquo;Is that all,
my Catherine,&rdquo; said he, pressing the weeping girl to his
bosom; &ldquo;then keep up your spirits, dearest, for I will
myself become a forester.&nbsp; I am not unacquainted with
woodcraft, for I was, when a boy, placed under the care of my
uncle, the chief forester Finsterbuch, in order to learn it, and
only at the earnest request of my uncle the steward, I exchanged
the shooting-pouch for the writing-desk.&nbsp; Of what
use,&rdquo; continued the lover, &ldquo;would his situation and
fine house be to me, if I cannot carry my Catherine there as the
mistress of it?&nbsp; If you are not more ambitious than your
mother, dearest, and William the gamekeeper will be as dear to
you as William the steward, I will become a woodsman directly;
for the merry life of a forester is more delightful to me than
the constrained habits of the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear, dear William,&rdquo; said Catherine,&mdash;all
the dark clouds of sorrow sweeping rapidly over her countenance,
and leaving only a few drops of glittering sunny rain, sparkling
in her sweet blue eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;O beloved William! if you
will indeed do this, all may yet be well: hasten to the forest,
seek my father, and speak to him ere he have time to pass his
word to Robert.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Away,&rdquo; replied William,
&ldquo;to the forest; I will seek him out, and <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>offer my
services as gamekeeper: fear nothing, Catherine; give me a gun,
and now for the huntsman&rsquo;s salute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What success he had in his undertaking was soon visible to the
anxious eye of Catherine, on her father&rsquo;s return with him
from the forest.&nbsp; &ldquo;A clever lad, that William,&rdquo;
said the old man; &ldquo;who would have expected such a shot in a
townsman?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll speak to the steward myself to-morrow;
it would be a thousand pities such a marksman should not stick to
the noble huntsman craft.&nbsp; Ha! ha! he will become a second
Kuno.&nbsp; But do you know who Kuno was?&rdquo; demanded he of
William.</p>
<p>The latter replied in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lo you there now!&rdquo; ejaculated Bertram; &ldquo;I
thought I had told you long since.&nbsp; He was my ancestor, the
first who possessed this situation.&nbsp; He was originally a
poor horseboy in the train of the knight of Wippach; but he was
clever, obliging, grew a favourite, and attended his master every
where, to tournaments and hunting parties.&nbsp; Once his knight
accompanied the duke on a grand hunting match, at which all the
nobles attended.&nbsp; The hounds chased a huge stag towards
them, upon whose back, to their great astonishment, sat tied a
human being, shrieking aloud in <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>a most frightful manner.&nbsp; There
existed at that period, among the feudal lords, an inhuman custom
of tying unhappy wretches who incurred their displeasure (perhaps
by slight transgressions against the hunting laws) upon stags,
and then driving them into the forest to perish miserably by
hunger, or at least to be torn to pieces by the brambles.&nbsp;
The duke was excessively enraged at this sight, and offered
immense rewards to any one who would shoot the stag; but clogged
his benefactions with death to the marksman, should his erring
bullet touch the victim, whose life he was desirous to preserve,
in order to ascertain the nature of his offence.&nbsp; Startled
by the conditions, not one of the train attempted the rescue of
the poor wretch, till Kuno, pitying his fate, stepped forward and
boldly offered his services.&nbsp; The duke having accepted them,
he took his rifle, loaded it in God&rsquo;s name, and earnestly
recommending the ball to all the saints and angels in heaven,
fired steadily into the bush in which he believed the stag had
taken refuge.&nbsp; His aim was true; the animal instantly sprung
out, plunged to the earth, and expired; but the poor culprit
escaped unhurt, except that his hands and face were miserably
torn by the briers.&nbsp; The duke kept his word well, and gave
to Kuno and his <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>descendants for ever this situation of forester.&nbsp;
But envy naturally follows merit, and my good ancestor was not
long in making the discovery.&nbsp; There were many of the
duke&rsquo;s people who had an eye to this situation, either for
themselves or some cousin or dear friend, and these persuaded
their masters that Kuno&rsquo;s wonderful success was entirely
owing to sorcery; upon which, though they could not turn him out
of his post, they obtained an order that every one of his
descendants should undergo a trial of his skill before he could
be accepted; but which, however, the chief forester of the
district, before whom the essay is made, can render as easy or
difficult as he pleases.&nbsp; I was obliged to shoot a ring out
of the beak of a wooden bird, which was swung backwards and
forwards; but I did not fail, any more than my forefathers; and
he who intends to succeed me, and wed my Catherine, must be at
least as good a marksman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William, who had listened very attentively, was delighted with
this piece of family history; he seized the old man&rsquo;s hand,
and joyously promised to become, under his direction, the very
first of marksmen; such as even grandfather Kuno himself should
have no cause to blush for.</p>
<p>Scarcely had fourteen happy days passed over <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>his head,
ere William was settled as gamekeeper in the forester&rsquo;s
house; and Bertram, who became fonder of him every day, gave his
formal consent to his engagement with Catherine.&nbsp; It was,
however, agreed that their betrothment should be kept secret
until the day of the marksman&rsquo;s trial, when the forester
expected to give a greater degree of splendour to his family
festival by the presence of the duke&rsquo;s commissary.&nbsp;
The bridegroom swam in an ocean of delight, and so entirely
forgot himself and the whole world in the sweet opening heaven of
love, that Bertram frequently insisted, that he had not been able
to hit a single mark since he had aimed so successfully at
Catherine.</p>
<p>And so it really was.&nbsp; From the day of his happy
betrothment, William had encountered nothing but disasters while
shooting.&nbsp; At one time his gun missed fire; at another, when
he aimed at a deer, he lodged the contents of his rifle in the
trunk of a tree: when he came home, and emptied his
shooting-pouch, he found, instead of partridges, rooks and crows,
and in lieu of hares, dead cats.&nbsp; The forester at length
grew seriously angry, and reproved him harshly for his
carelessness; even Catherine began to tremble for the success of
the master-shot.</p>
<p>William redoubled his diligence, but to no <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>purpose;
the nearer the approach of the important day, the more alarming
grew his misfortunes; every shot missed.&nbsp; At length he was
almost afraid to fire a gun, lest he should do some mischief; for
he had already lamed a cow and almost killed the cowherd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I insist upon it,&rdquo; said the gamekeeper Rudolph,
one evening, to the party, &ldquo;I insist upon it that some
wizard has bewitched William, for such things could not happen
naturally; therefore let us endeavour to loosen the
charm.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Superstitious stuff!&rdquo;
interrupted Bertram, angrily; &ldquo;an honest woodsman should
not even think of such trash.&nbsp; Do you forget the three
things which a forester ought to have, and with which he will
always be successful, in spite of sorcery?&nbsp; Come, to your
wits, answer my query.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That can I
truly,&rdquo; answered Rudolph; &ldquo;he should have great
skill, a keen dog, and a good gun.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said Bertram; &ldquo;with these three
things every charm may be loosened, or the owner of them is a
dunce and no shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under favour, father Bertram,&rdquo; said William,
&ldquo;here is my gun; what have you to object against it? and as
for my skill, I do not like to praise myself, but I think I am as
fair a sportsman as any in the country; nevertheless, it seems <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>as if all
my balls went crooked, or as if the wind blew them away from the
barrel of my gun.&nbsp; Only tell me what I shall do.&nbsp; I am
willing to do any thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
singular,&rdquo; muttered the forester, who did not know what
else to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, William,&rdquo; again began Rudolph,
&ldquo;it is nothing but what I have said.&nbsp; Try only once:
go on a Friday, at midnight, to a cross road, and make a circle
round you with the ramrod, or with a bloody sword, which must be
blessed three times, in the name of
Sammiel&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; interrupted Bertram,
angrily: &ldquo;know ye whose name that is? he is one of the
fiend&rsquo;s dark legion.&nbsp; God protect us and every
Christian from him!&rdquo;&nbsp; William crossed himself
devoutly, and would hear nothing further, though Rudolph still
maintained his opinion.&nbsp; He passed the night in cleaning his
gun, and examining minutely every screw, resolving, at dawn of
day, once more to sally forth, and try his fortune in the
forest.&nbsp; He did so, but, alas! in vain.&nbsp; Mischiefs
thickened round him: at ten paces distance he fired three times
at a deer; twice his gun missed fire, and although it went off
the third time, yet the stag bounded away unhurt into the midst
of the forest.&nbsp; Full of vexation, he threw himself under a
tree, and cursed his <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>fate, when suddenly a rustling was
heard among the bushes, and a queer-looking soldier with a wooden
leg came hopping out from among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holloa! huntsman,&rdquo; he began, laughing at the
disconsolate-looking William, &ldquo;what is the matter with
you?&nbsp; Are you in love, or is your purse empty, or has any
body charmed your gun?&nbsp; Come, don&rsquo;t look so blank;
give me a pipe of tobacco, and we&rsquo;ll have a chat
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William sullenly gave him what he asked, and the soldier threw
himself down in the grass by the side of him.&nbsp; The
conversation naturally turned upon woodcraft, and William related
his misfortunes to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me see your gun,&rdquo;
said the soldier.&nbsp; William gave it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
assuredly bewitched,&rdquo; said he of the wooden leg, the moment
he had taken it in his hand; &ldquo;you will not be able to fire
a single shot with it; and if they have done it according to
rule, it will be the same with every gun you shall take into your
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William was startled; he endeavoured to raise objections
against the stranger&rsquo;s belief in witches, but the latter
offered to give him a proof of the justice of his opinions.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To us soldiers,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is nothing
strange; and I could tell <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>you many wonderful things, but which
would detain us here till night.&nbsp; But look here, for
instance: this is a ball which is sure of hitting its mark,
because it possesses some particular virtue: try it; you
won&rsquo;t miss.&rdquo;&nbsp; William loaded his gun, and looked
around for an object to aim at.&nbsp; A large bird of prey
hovered high above the forest, like a moving
dot;&mdash;&ldquo;Shoot that kite,&rdquo; said the one-legged
companion.&nbsp; William laughed at his absurdity, for the bird
was hovering at a height which the eye itself could scarcely
reach.&nbsp; &ldquo;Laugh not, but fire,&rdquo; said the other,
grimly; &ldquo;I will lay my wooden leg that it
falls.&rdquo;&nbsp; William fired, the black dot sunk, and a huge
kite fell bleeding to the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;You would not be
surprised at that,&rdquo; said he of the wooden leg to the
huntsman, who was speechless and staring with astonishment;
&ldquo;you would not, I repeat, be surprised at that, if you were
better acquainted with the wonders of your craft.&nbsp; Even the
casting such balls as these is one of the least important things
in it; it merely requires dexterity and courage, because it must
be done in the night.&nbsp; I will teach you for nothing when we
meet again; now I must away, for the bell has told seven.&nbsp;
In the mean time&mdash;here, try a few of my balls; <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>still you
look incredulous&mdash;well&mdash;till we meet
again.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>The soldier gave William a handful of balls, and
departed.&nbsp; Full of astonishment, and still distrusting the
evidence of his senses, the latter tried another of the balls,
and again struck an almost unattainable object: he loaded his gun
in the usual manner, and again missed the easiest!&nbsp; He
darted forward to follow the crippled soldier, but the latter was
no longer in the forest; and William was obliged to remain
satisfied with the promise which he had given of meeting him
again hereafter.</p>
<p>Great joy it gave to the honest forester when William
returned, as before, loaded with game from the forest.&nbsp; He
was now called upon to explain the circumstance; but not being
prepared to give a reason, and above all, dreading to say any
thing upon the subject of his infallible balls, he attributed his
ill luck to a fault in his gun, which he had only, he pretended,
last night discovered and rectified.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did I not tell
you so, wife,&rdquo; said Bertram, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your
demon was lodged in the barrel; and the goblin which threw down
father Kuno this morning, sat grinning on the rusty
nail.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What say you of a goblin,&rdquo;
demanded <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>William; &ldquo;and what has happened to father
Kuno?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Simply this,&rdquo; replied Bertram;
&ldquo;his portrait fell of itself from the wall this morning,
just as the bell tolled seven; and the silly woman settled it
that a goblin must be at the bottom of the mischief, and that we
are haunted accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At seven,&rdquo; repeated William, &ldquo;at
seven!&rdquo; and he thought, with a strange feeling of affright,
of the soldier who parted from him exactly at that moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, seven,&rdquo; continued Bertram, still
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not wonder at your surprise; it is
not a usual ghostly hour, but Anne would have it so.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The latter shook her head doubtfully, and prayed that all might
end well; while William shivered from head to foot, and would
secretly have vowed not to use the magic balls, but that the
thought of his ill luck haunted him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only one of
them,&rdquo; said he internally; &ldquo;only one of them for the
master-shot, and then I have done with them for
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the forester urged him the next instant to
accompany him into the forest; and as he dared not excite fresh
suspicions of his want of skill, nor offend the old man by
refusing, he was again compelled to make use of his wondrous
balls; and in the course of a few days he had so accustomed
himself to the use of them, and so <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>entirely reconciled his conscience
to their doubtful origin, that he saw nothing sinful or even
objectionable in the business.&nbsp; He constantly traversed the
forest, in the hope of meeting the strange giver of the balls;
for the handful had decreased to two, and if he wished to make
sure of the master-shot, the utmost economy was necessary.&nbsp;
One day he even refused to accompany Bertram, for the next was to
be the day of trial, and the chief forester was expected: it was
possible he might require other proofs than the mere formal
essay, and William thus felt himself secure.&nbsp; But in the
evening, instead of the commissary, came a messenger from the
duke, with an order for a large delivery of game, and to announce
that the visit of the chief forester would be postponed for eight
days longer.</p>
<p>William felt as if he could have sunk into the bosom of the
earth, as he listened to the message, and his excessive alarm
would have excited strange suspicions, if all present had not
been ready to ascribe it to the delay of his expected
nuptials.&nbsp; He was now obliged to sacrifice at least one of
his balls, but he solemnly swore nothing should rob him of the
other but the forester&rsquo;s master-shot.</p>
<p>Bertram was outrageously angry when William <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>returned
from the forest with only one stag; for the delivery order was
considerable.&nbsp; He was still more angry the next day at noon,
when Rudolph returned loaded with an immense quantity of game,
and William returned with none: he threatened to dismiss him, and
retract his promise respecting Catherine, if he did not bring
down at least two deer on the following day.&nbsp; Catherine was
in the greatest consternation, and earnestly besought him to make
use of his utmost skill, and not let a thought of her interrupt
his duties while occupied in the forest.&nbsp; He
departed&mdash;his heart loaded with despair.&nbsp; Catherine, he
saw too plainly, was lost to him for ever; and nothing remained
but the choice of the manner in which he should destroy his
happiness.&nbsp; Whilst he stood lost in the agonising
anticipation of his impending doom, a herd of deer approached
close to him.&nbsp; Mechanically he felt for his last ball; it
felt tremendously heavy in his hand: he was on the point of
dropping it back, resolving to preserve his treasure at every
hazard, when suddenly he saw&mdash;O sight of joy!&mdash;the
one-legged soldier approaching.&nbsp; Delightedly he let the ball
drop into the barrel, fired, brought down a brace of deer, and
hastened forward to meet his friend; but he was gone!&nbsp;
William could not discover him in the forest.</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>&ldquo;Hark ye, William!&rdquo; said the forester to
him in the evening, rousing him from the torpor of grief into
which he had fallen; &ldquo;you must resent this affront as
earnestly as myself: nobody shall dare utter falsehoods of our
ancestor Kuno, nor accuse him as Rudolph is now doing.&nbsp; I
insist,&rdquo; continued he, turning again to the latter,
&ldquo;if good angels helped him, (which was very likely, for in
the Old Testament we frequently read of instances of their
protection,) we ought to be grateful, and praise the wonderful
goodness of God.&nbsp; But nobody shall accuse Kuno of practising
the black art.&nbsp; He died happily&mdash;ay, and holily, in his
bed, surrounded by children and grandchildren,&mdash;which he who
carries on a correspondence with the evil one never does.&nbsp; I
saw a terrible example of that myself, when I was a
forester&rsquo;s boy in Bohemia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hear how it happened, good Bertram,&rdquo; said
all the listeners; and the forester nodded gravely, and
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shiver when I think of it; but I will tell you
nevertheless.&nbsp; When a young man, practising with other
youths under the chief foresters, there used frequently to join
us a town lad, a fine daring fellow, who, being a great lover of
field sports, came out to us as often as he <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>could.&nbsp; He would have made a good marksman, but
was too flighty and thoughtless; so that he frequently missed his
mark.&nbsp; Once, when we ridiculed his awkwardness, we provoked
him into a rage, and he swore by all that was holy that he would
soon fire with a more certain aim than any gamekeeper in the
country, and that no animal should escape him, either in the air
or on the earth.&nbsp; But he kept his light oath badly.&nbsp; A
few days afterwards an unknown huntsman roused us early, and told
us that a man was lying in the road and dying without
assistance.&nbsp; It was poor Schmid.&nbsp; He was covered with
wounds and blood, as if he had been torn by wild beasts: he could
not speak, for he was quite senseless, with scarcely any
appearance of life.&nbsp; He was conveyed to Prague, and just
before his death declared, that he had been out with an old
mountain huntsman to a cross road, in order to cast the magic
balls, which are sure of hitting their mark; but that making some
fault or omission, the demon had treated him so roughly that it
would cost him his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he not explain?&rdquo; asked William,
shuddering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; replied the forester.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
declared before a court of justice, that he went out to the cross
road with the old gamekeeper; that they <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>made a
circle with a bloody sword, and afterwards set it round with
skulls and bones.&nbsp; The mountain hunter then gave his
directions to Schmid as to what he was to do: he was to begin
when the clock struck eleven to cast the balls, and neither to
cast more nor fewer than sixty-three; one either above or under
this number would, when the bell tolled midnight, be the cause of
his destruction: neither was he to speak a single word during his
work, nor move from the circle, whatever might happen, above,
below, or around him.&nbsp; Fulfilling these conditions, sixty
balls would be sure of hitting, and the remaining three only
would miss.&nbsp; Schmid had actually begun casting the balls
when, according to what we could gather from him, he saw such
cruel and dreadful apparitions, that he at length shrieked and
sprung out of the circle, falling senseless to the ground; from
which trance he did not recover till under the hands of the
physician in Prague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven preserve us!&rdquo; said the forester&rsquo;s
wife, crossing herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a very deadly sin
undoubtedly,&rdquo; pursued Bertram, &ldquo;and a true woodsman
would scorn such practice.&nbsp; He needs nothing but skill, and
a good gun, as you have lately experienced, William.&nbsp; I
would not, for my own part, fire off such balls for any price; I
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>should
always fear the fiend would, at some time or other, conduct the
ball to his own mark instead of to mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Night drew round them with the conclusion of the
forester&rsquo;s story.&nbsp; <i>He</i> went to his quiet bed,
but William remained in restless agony.&nbsp; It was in vain that
he attempted to compose himself.&nbsp; Sleep fled entirely from
his spirit.&nbsp; Strange objects flitted past him, and hovered
like dark omens over his pillow.&nbsp; The strange soldier of the
forest, Schmid, Catherine, the duke&rsquo;s commissary, all
rushed before his eyes, and his fevered imagination converted
them into the most dreadful groups.&nbsp; Now, the miserable
Schmid stood warningly before him, and hollowly pointed to his
newly bleeding wounds; then the dark distorted face faded to the
pallid features of Catherine wrestling with the strength of
death; while the wild soldier of the forest stood mocking his
agony with a hellish laugh of scorn.&nbsp; The scene then changed
to his mind, and he stood in the forest before the commissary,
preparing for the master-shot.&nbsp; He
aimed&mdash;fired&mdash;missed, Catherine sunk down on the
earth.&nbsp; Bertram drove him away; while the one-legged
soldier, now again a friend, brought him fresh balls; but too
late&mdash;the trial was over, and he was lost.</p>
<p><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>In
this manner wore away his agonised night, and with the earliest
dawn he sought the forest, hoping to meet with the soldier; the
clear morning air chased away the dark images of sleep from his
brow, and ennerved his drooping spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo;
said he to himself, &ldquo;because I cannot understand what is
mysterious, must the mystery therefore be a sin?&nbsp; Is what I
seek so contrary to nature that it requires the aid of spirits to
obtain it?&nbsp; Does not man govern the mighty instinct of
animals, and make them move according to the will of their
master?&nbsp; Why then should he not be able, by natural means,
to command the course of inanimate metal which receives force and
motion only through him?&nbsp; Nature is rich in wonders which we
do not comprehend, and shall I forfeit my happiness for an
ignorant prejudice only?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Spirits I will not call
upon, but nature and her hidden powers I will challenge and use,
even though unable to explain its mystery.&nbsp; I will seek the
soldier, and, if I cannot find him, I will at least be bolder
than Schmid, for I have a better cause.&nbsp; He was urged by
presumption, I by love and honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the soldier appeared not, however earnestly William sought
him; neither could any of those of whom he inquired give him the
slightest <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>information respecting him, and two days were wasted in
these anxious and fruitless inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then be it so,&rdquo; exclaimed the unhappy young man;
and in a fit of despair he resolved to cast the magic balls in
the forest.&nbsp; &ldquo;My days,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;are
numbered to me; this night will I seek the cross road.&nbsp; Into
its silent and solitary recess no one will dare to intrude; and
the terrible circle will I not leave till the fearful work shall
be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when the shadows of evening fell upon the earth, and after
William had provided lead, bullet-mould, and coals, for his
nocturnal occupation, he was gently detained by Bertram, who
felt, he said, so severe an oppression, that he entreated him to
remain in his chamber during the night.&nbsp; Catherine offered
her services, but they were, to her astonishment, declined.&nbsp;
&ldquo;At any other time,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;I should
have preferred you, but to-night it must be William.&nbsp; I
shall be happier if he will remain with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William hesitated.&nbsp; He grew sick in his inmost
heart.&nbsp; He would have objected, but Catherine&rsquo;s
entreaties were so earnest, her voice so irresistible, that he
had nothing to oppose against her wishes.&nbsp; He remained in
the chamber, and in the morning Bertram&rsquo;s dark fears had
faded, and <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>he laughed at his own absurdity.&nbsp; He proposed
going to the forest, but William, who intended to devote the day
to his search for the soldier, dissuaded him, and departed
alone.&nbsp; He went, but returned disappointed, and once more
resolved to seek the forest at night.&nbsp; As he approached the
house, Catherine met him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beloved William,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;you have a visitor, and a dear one, but you must
guess who it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William was not at all disposed to guess, and still less to
receive visits; for at that time the dearest friend would have
been the most unwelcome intruder.&nbsp; He answered peevishly,
and was thinking of a pretext to turn back, when the door of the
house opened, and the pale moon threw her soft ray upon a
venerable old man, in the garb of a huntsman, who extended his
arms towards him; and &ldquo;William!&rdquo; said a kind and
well-known voice, and the next instant the young forester found
himself folded to the bosom of his beloved uncle.</p>
<p>Ah! magic of early ties, dear recollections, and filial
gratitude!&nbsp; William felt them all; his heart was full of
joy, and all other thoughts were forgotten.&nbsp; Suddenly spoke
the warning voice to the tranquil happy dreamer.&nbsp; The
midnight hour struck, and William, with a shudder, remembered <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>what he had
lost.&nbsp; &ldquo;But one night more remains to me,&rdquo; said
he; &ldquo;to-morrow, or never.&rdquo;&nbsp; His violent agony
did not escape the eye of his uncle, but he ascribed it to
fatigue, and excused himself for detaining him from his needful
rest, on account of his own departure, which he could not delay
beyond the following day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet grieve not,
William,&rdquo; said the old man as he retired to rest;
&ldquo;grieve not for this short hour thus spent, you will only
sleep the sounder for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; William shivered, for to
his ear these words conveyed a deeper meaning.&nbsp; There was a
dark foreboding in his heart, that the execution of his plan
would for ever banish the quiet of sleep from his soul.</p>
<p>But day dawned&mdash;passed&mdash;and evening descended.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It must be now or never,&rdquo; thought William,
&ldquo;for to-morrow will be the day of trial.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
females had been busied in preparations for the wedding and the
reception of their distinguished guest.&nbsp; Anne embraced
William when he returned, and, for the first time, saluted him
with the dear name of son.&nbsp; The tender joy of a young and
happy bride glittered in the sweet eyes of Catherine.&nbsp; The
supper-table was covered with flowers, good food, and large
bottles of long-hoarded wine from the stores of Bertram.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Children,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;this is our own
festival; let us, therefore, <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>be happy: to-morrow we shall not be
alone, though you may, perhaps, be happier.&nbsp; I have invited
the priest, dear William, and when the trial is
over&rdquo;&mdash;A loud shriek from Catherine interrupted the
forester.&nbsp; Kuno&rsquo;s picture had again fallen from its
place, and had struck her severely on the forehead.&nbsp; Bertram
grew angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot conceive,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;why this picture is not hung properly; this is the second
time it has given us a fright: are you hurt,
Catherine?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is of no consequence,&rdquo;
replied the maiden, gently wiping away the blood from her bright
curls; &ldquo;I am less hurt than frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William grew sick when he beheld her pale face, and forehead
bathed in blood.&nbsp; So he had seen her in his distempered
dreams on that dreadful night: and this reality conjured up all
those fearful fantasies anew.&nbsp; His determination of
proceeding in his plan was shaken; but the wine, which he drank
in greater quantities than usual, filled him with a wild courage,
and ennerved him to undertake its execution.&nbsp; The clock
struck nine.&nbsp; Love and valour must combat with danger,
thought William.&nbsp; But he sought in vain for a decent
pretence to leave his Catherine.&nbsp; How could he quit her on
the bridal eve?&nbsp; Time flew with the rapidity of an arrow,
and he suffered <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>agonies even in the soft arms of rewarding love.&nbsp;
Ten o&rsquo;clock struck: the decisive moment was come.&nbsp;
Without taking leave, William started from his bride, and left
the house to range the forest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whither go you,
William?&rdquo; said her mother, following him, alarmed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have shot a deer, which I had forgotten,&rdquo; answered
the youth.&nbsp; She still entreated, and Catherine looked
terrified, for she felt that there was something (though she knew
not what) to fear, from his distracted manner.&nbsp; But their
supplications were unheeded.&nbsp; William sprung from them both,
and hastened into the forest.</p>
<p>The moon was on the wane, and gleamed a dark red light above
the horizon.&nbsp; Grey clouds flew rapidly past, and sometimes
darkened the surrounding country, which was soon relighted up by
the wild and glittering moonlight.&nbsp; The birch and aspen
trees nodded like spectres in the shade; and to William the
silver poplar was a white shadowy figure, which solemnly waved,
and beckoned him to return.&nbsp; He started, and felt as if the
two extraordinary interpositions to his plan, and the repeated
falls of the picture, were the last admonitions of his departing
angel, who thus warned him against the commission of an unblessed
deed.&nbsp; Once more he wavered in his intention.&nbsp; <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Now he had
even determined to return, when a voice whispered close to him,
&ldquo;Fool! hast thou not already used the magic balls, and dost
thou only dread the toil of labouring for them?&rdquo;&nbsp; He
paused.&nbsp; The moon shone brilliantly out from a dark cloud,
and lighted up the tranquil roof of the forester&rsquo;s humble
dwelling.&nbsp; William saw Catherine&rsquo;s window shine in the
silvery ray, and he stretched out his arms towards it, and again
directed his steps towards his home.&nbsp; Then the voice rose
whisperingly again around him, and, &ldquo;Hence!&mdash;to thy
work!&mdash;away!&rdquo; it murmured; while a strong gust of wind
brought to his ear the stroke of the second quarter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To my work,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;ay; it is cowardly
to return half way&mdash;foolish to give up the great object,
when, for a lesser, I have already perhaps risked my
salvation.&nbsp; I will finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode rapidly forward.&nbsp; The wind drove the fugitive
clouds over the moon, and William entered the deep darkness of
the forest.&nbsp; Now he stood upon the cross road; the magic
circle was drawn; the skulls and bones of the dead laid in order
around it; the moon buried herself deeper in the cloudy mass, and
left the glimmering coals, at intervals fanned into a blaze by
the fitful gusts of wind, alone to lighten the midnight deed,
with <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>a
wild and melancholy glare.&nbsp; Remotely the third quarter
sounded from a dull and heavy tower clock.&nbsp; William put the
casting ladle upon the coals, and threw the lead into it,
together with three balls, which had already hit their mark,
according to the huntsman&rsquo;s usage; then the forest began to
be in motion; the night ravens, owls, and bats, fluttered up and
down, blinded by the glare of light.&nbsp; They fell from their
boughs, and placed themselves among the bones around the circle,
where, with hollow croakings and wild jabberings, they held an
unintelligible conversation with the skulls.&nbsp; Momentarily
their numbers increased, and among and above them hovered pale
cloudy forms, some shaped like animals, some like human
beings.&nbsp; The gusts of wind sported frightfully with their
dusky vapoury forms, scattering and reuniting them like the dews
of the evening shades.&nbsp; One form alone stood motionless and
unchanged near the circle, gazing with fixed and woful looks at
William; once it lifted up its pale hands in sorrow, and seemed
to sigh.&nbsp; The fire burned gloomily at the moment; but a
large grey owl flapped its wings, and fanned the dying embers
into light.&nbsp; William turned shivering away; for the
countenance of his <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>dead mother gazed mournfully at him from the dark and
dusky figure.</p>
<p>The bell tolled eleven; the pale figure vanished with a groan;
the owls and night ravens flew screeching up into the air, and
the skulls and bones clattered beneath their wings.&nbsp; William
knelt down by his hearth of coals.&nbsp; He began steadily to
cast, and, with the last sound of the bell, the first ball fell
from the mould.</p>
<p>The owls and the skulls were quiet; but along the road an old
woman, bent down with the weight of age, advanced towards the
circle.&nbsp; She was hung round with wooden spoons, ladles, and
other kitchen utensils, which made a frightful clattering.&nbsp;
The owls screeched at her approach, and caressed her with their
wings.&nbsp; Arrived at the circle, she stooped down to seize the
bones and the skulls; but the coals hissed flames at her, and she
drew back her withered hands from the fire.&nbsp; Then she paced
round the circle, and, grinning and chattering, held up her wares
towards William.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me the skulls,&rdquo; she
gabbled; &ldquo;give me the skulls, and I will give thee my
treasures; give me the skulls, the skulls; what canst thou want
with the trash?&nbsp; Thou art mine&mdash;mine, dear bridegroom;
none can help thee: <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>thou canst not escape me; thou must
lead with me in the bridal dance.&nbsp; Come away, thou
bridegroom mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>William&rsquo;s heart throbbed; but he remained silent, and
hastened on with his work.&nbsp; The old woman was not a stranger
to him.&nbsp; A mad beggar had often haunted the neighbourhood,
until she found an asylum in the mad-house.&nbsp; Now, he knew
not whether her appearance was a reality or a delusion.&nbsp; In
a short time she grew enraged, threw down her stick, and
chattered anew at William.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take these for our
nuptial night,&rdquo; she cried: &ldquo;the bridal bed is ready,
and to-morrow, when evening cometh, thou wilt be wedded to
me.&nbsp; Come soon, my love; delay not, my bridegroom; come
soon.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she hobbled slowly away into the
forest.</p>
<p>Suddenly there arose a rattling like the noise of wheels,
mingled with the cracking of whips and shouting of men.&nbsp; A
carriage came headlong, with six horses and outriders.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is the meaning of all this in the road?&rdquo; cried
the foremost horseman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Room there!&rdquo;&nbsp;
William looked up.&nbsp; Fire sprung from the hoofs of the
horses, and round the wheels of the carriage: it shone like the
glimmering of phosphorus.&nbsp; He suspected a magical delusion,
and remained quiet.&nbsp; <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>&ldquo;On, on, upon it!&mdash;over
it!&mdash;down! down!&rdquo; cried the horseman; and in a moment
the whole troop stormed in headlong upon the circle.&nbsp;
William plunged down to the earth, and the horses reared
furiously above his head; but the airy cavalry whirled high in
the air with the carriage, and, after turning several times round
the magic circle, disappeared in a storm of wind, which tore the
tops of the mightiest trees, and scattered their branches to a
distance.</p>
<p>Some time elapsed ere William could recover from his
terror.&nbsp; At length he compelled his trembling fingers to be
steady, and cast a few balls without farther interruption.&nbsp;
Again the well-known tower clock struck, and to him in the
dreadful solitary circle, consoling as the voice of humanity,
rose the sound from the habitations of men, but the clock struck
the quarter thrice.&nbsp; He shuddered at the lightning-like
flight of time; for a third part of his work was hardly
done.&nbsp; Again the clock struck, for the fourth
time!&mdash;Horror!&mdash;his strength was annihilated, every
limb was palsied, and the mould fell out of his trembling
hand.&nbsp; He listened, in the quiet resignation of despair, for
the stroke of the full, the terrible, midnight hour.&nbsp; The
sound hesitated&mdash;delayed&mdash;was silent.&nbsp; To palter
with the awful midnight was <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>too daring and too dangerous even to
the dreadful powers of darkness.&nbsp; Hope again raised the sunk
heart of William; he hastily drew out his watch, and beheld it
pointing to the second quarter of the hour.&nbsp; He looked
gratefully up towards heaven, and a feeling of piety moderated
the transport, which, contrary to the laws of the dark world,
would otherwise have burst forth in loud and joyous
exclamations.</p>
<p>Strengthened, by the experience of the last half-hour, against
any new delusion, William now went boldly on with his work.&nbsp;
Every thing was silent around him, except that the owls snored in
their uneasy sleep, and at intervals struck their beaks against
the bones of the dead.&nbsp; Suddenly it was broken by a
crackling among the bushes.&nbsp; The sound was familiar to the
sportsman, and, as he expected, a huge wild boar broke through
the briers, and came foaming towards the circle.&nbsp; Believing
this to be a reality, he sprung hastily on his feet, seized his
gun, and attempted to fire.&nbsp; Not a single spark came from
the flint.&nbsp; Startled at his danger, he drew his hunting
knife to attack it,&mdash;when the bristly savage, like the
carriage and the horses, ascended high above his head, and
vanished into the silent fields of air.</p>
<p>The anxious lover worked on steadily to regain <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>the time he
had so unhappily lost.&nbsp; Sixty balls were cast.&nbsp; He
looked joyfully upwards; the clouds were dispersing, and the moon
again threw her bright rays upon the surrounding country; he was
rejoicing in the approaching end of his labours, when an agonised
voice, in the tones of Catherine, shrieked out the name of
&ldquo;William!&rdquo;&nbsp; In the next moment, he beheld his
beloved dart from among the bushes, and gaze fearfully around
her.&nbsp; Following her distracted steps, and panting closely
behind her, trod the mad beggar woman, extending her withered
arms towards the fugitive, whose light dress, fluttering in the
wind, she repeatedly attempted to grasp.&nbsp; Catherine
collected her expiring strength in one desperate effort to
escape, when the long-sought soldier of the forest planted
himself before her and delayed her flight.&nbsp; The hesitation
of the moment gained time for the mad woman, who sprung wildly
upon Catherine, and grasped her in her long and fleshless
hands.&nbsp; William could endure it no longer, he dashed the
last ball from his hand, and was on the point of springing from
the circle, when the bell tolled midnight, and the delusion
vanished.&nbsp; The owls knocked the skulls and bones cluttering
against each other, and flew up again to their hiding places; the
coals were suddenly extinguished; <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>and William sunk, exhausted with
fatigue, to the earth; but there was no rest for him in the
forest; he was again disturbed by the slow and sullen approach of
a stranger, mounted upon a huge and coal-black steed: he stopped
before the demolished magic circle, and, addressing the
huntsman,&mdash;&ldquo;You have stood the trial well,&rdquo; said
he; &ldquo;what do you require of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of you, stranger, nothing,&rdquo; replied William;
&ldquo;of that of which I had need, I have prepared for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But with my assistance,&rdquo; continued the stranger;
&ldquo;therefore a share of it belongs to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied the huntsman; &ldquo;I have
neither hired you nor called upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horseman smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are bolder than your
equals are wont to be,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take then the
balls which you have cast: sixty for you, three for me.&nbsp; The
first hit, the second miss.&nbsp; When we meet again you will
understand me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William turned away.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not meet you again; I
will never see you more,&rdquo; he cried, trembling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why do you turn from me?&rdquo; demanded the stranger,
with a horrible laugh: &ldquo;do you know me?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No; no,&rdquo; said the huntsman, shuddering; &ldquo;I
know you not; I will not <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>even look upon you.&nbsp; Whoever
you may be, leave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black horseman turned his steed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The rising
hairs of your head,&rdquo; cried he with gloomy gravity,
&ldquo;declare that you do know me.&nbsp; You are right; I am he
whom you name in the secrecy of your soul, and shudder to think
you have done so.&rdquo;&nbsp; At these words he disappeared, and
the trees under which he had stood let their withered branches
sink helpless and dead to the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merciful Heaven! William,&rdquo; said Catherine, on
remarking his pale and distracted look on his return after
midnight; &ldquo;what has happened to you? you look as if you had
just risen from the grave.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the night
air,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;and I am not well.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But, William,&rdquo; said the forester, who had just
entered, &ldquo;why then would you go to the forest: something
has happened to you there.&nbsp; Boy, you cannot thus blind
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William was startled; the sad solemnity of Bertram&rsquo;s
manner struck him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, something has
occurred,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but have patience for a few
days, and all shall be explained to your
satisfaction.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Willingly, dear son,&rdquo;
interrupted the forester; &ldquo;question him no further,
Catherine.&nbsp; Go to your needful rest, William, and indulge in
<a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>hope of
the future.&nbsp; He who goes on in his occupation openly and
honestly, never can be harmed by the evil spirits of the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William had need of all his dissimulation; for the old
man&rsquo;s observations so nearly meeting the truth, his
forbearing love, and unshaken confidence in William&rsquo;s
honesty, altogether distracted his mind: he hastened to his room,
determined to destroy the magical preparation.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
one ball&mdash;only one will I use,&rdquo; exclaimed he, weeping
aloud, with his folded hands held up to heaven; &ldquo;and surely
this determination will efface the sin of the deed I have
committed.&nbsp; With a thousand acts of penitence I will make
atonement for what is past, for I cannot now step back without
betraying my happiness, my honour, and my love.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
with this resolution he calmed the tumult of his spirits, and met
the rays of the morning sun with more tranquillity than he had
dared to hope.</p>
<p>The commissary of the duke arrived; he proposed a shooting
party in the forest, before the trial of skill took place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For, though we must certainly retain the old form,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;of the essay shot, yet the skill of the huntsman
is, after all, best proved in the forest: so come, young
marksman, to the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>William&rsquo;s cheek grew pale, and he earnestly tried
to excuse himself from accompanying them.&nbsp; But, when this
was refused by the chief forester, he entreated at least to be
allowed to fire his trial shot before their departure.&nbsp; Old
Bertram shook his head, doubtingly: &ldquo;William,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;should my suspicion of yesterday be
just&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; replied the youth; and no
longer daring to hesitate, he departed with them to the
forest.</p>
<p>Bertram had in vain endeavoured to suppress his forebodings
and assume a cheerful countenance.&nbsp; Catherine too was
dejected, and it was not until the arrival of the priest that she
recollected her nuptial garland: her mother had locked it up,
and, in her haste to open the chest, broke the lock, and was
obliged to send into the village for another wreath, as too much
time had been wasted in endeavouring to recover the first.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let them give you the handsomest,&rdquo; said Anne to the
little messenger, &ldquo;the very handsomest they
have.&rdquo;&nbsp; The boy accordingly chose the most glittering,
and the seller, who misunderstood him, gave him a death garland,
composed of myrtle and rosemary, intermingled with silver.&nbsp;
The mother and daughter beheld and recognised the mysterious
intimation of fate; they embraced each other in silence, and
endeavoured to smile <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>away their terror, in imputing it to
the boy&rsquo;s mistake.&nbsp; Again the broken lock was tried;
it opened easily now; the wreaths were changed, and the bridal
garland was twined around Catherine&rsquo;s brilliant locks.</p>
<p>The sportsmen returned from the forest.&nbsp; The commissary
was inexhaustible on the subject of William&rsquo;s wondrous
skill.&nbsp; &ldquo;It almost appears ridiculous,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;after such proofs, to require any further trial; yet, in
honour of the old custom, we must perform what appears
superfluous; we will therefore finish the business as quickly as
possible.&nbsp; There, upon that pillar, sits a dove, shoot
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said
Catherine, hastily approaching, &ldquo;do not shoot that
dove.&nbsp; Alas! in my sleep last night I was myself a dove, and
my mother, while fastening a ring round my neck, on your
approaching us became covered with blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William drew back his gun; but the chief forester
smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;So timid, little maiden!&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that will never do for a huntsman&rsquo;s bride: come,
courage! courage!&mdash;or is the dove a favourite,
perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;it is but
fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; replied the commissary, &ldquo;have
courage; and now, William, fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>The
shot fell, and, in the same moment, Catherine sunk, with a loud
scream, to the earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Silly girl,&rdquo; exclaimed
the commissary, lifting her up: but a stream of blood flowed over
her face, her forehead was shattered, for the ball of the rifle
was lodged in the wound.&nbsp; William turned, on hearing loud
shrieks behind him, and beheld his Catherine pale, weltering in
her blood, and by her side the soldier of the forest, who, with a
fiendish laugh of scorn, pointed to his dying victim, and cried
aloud to William, &ldquo;Sixty hit, three miss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accursed fiend!&rdquo; shrieked the wretched youth,
striking at the detested form with his sword, &ldquo;hast thou
thus deceived me?&rdquo;&nbsp; His agony permitted no further
expression, for he sunk senseless to the earth by the side of the
victim bride.&nbsp; The commissary and priest in vain endeavoured
to console the childless heart-broken parents.&nbsp; The mother
had scarcely laid the prophetic garland of death upon the bosom
of the bridal corpse, when her sorrow and life expired with her
last-shed tear: the solitary father soon followed her, and the
miserable William closed his life in the mad-house.</p>

FORTUNES OF DE LA POLE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when

Then a spirit passed before my face, the hair of my head stood

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Job</i>, chap. iv.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in the seventeenth century,
on a very cold November morning, a gentleman of Winchester was
returning to his home, by a road which then led by the borders of
the New Forest.&nbsp; He was conversing gaily with his
attendants, when his dogs arrested the mirth of the party, by
darting suddenly into the mazes of the forest, and signifying
their discovery of some unusual object by loud and continued
howls.&nbsp; Sir Bernard Courtenay instantly followed their
track, and was startled by discovering, amid the tangled bushes,
the corpse of a man, frightfully mangled, and <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>which
appeared to have lain some time in its concealment.&nbsp; Little
observation was necessary to point out the identity of the
sufferer,&mdash;Sir Bernard Courtenay almost instantly recognised
an intimate friend; and, with deep and painful commiseration,
prepared to assist his attendants to convey the body to its
home.</p>
<p>Many conjectures were immediately afloat, as to the cause and
perpetrator of this dreadful act, and, as is ever usual in such
cases, many more absurd and irrational than just:&mdash;there was
no apparent possibility of tracing the fact; it appeared to mock
all the art and all the power of justice.&nbsp; He had not been
robbed&mdash;murder alone had been intended, and had alone been
perpetrated; so that one fact at least was clear, that this deed
had been the work of an enemy: no common one, it was presumed, if
the appearance of the corpse might weigh any thing in evidence;
it was mangled fearfully, and the frightful distension of the
muscles, the grim and rigid expression of the features, the many
deep and bloody wounds upon the body, and the firm and powerful
grasp with which the strained fingers of one hand clenched a dark
lock of human hair, while those of the other as firmly closed
over the hilt of a broken dagger, gave tokens that a fierce and
<a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>terrible
struggle had preceded his unexpected destruction.&nbsp; It was
hoped, that some corresponding token of wounds and fierce
exertion might lead to a discovery of the murderer; for none
deemed, after beholding the body, and calling to mind the noble
courage of the victim when in life, that the destroyer could pass
from that gripe unharmed.</p>
<p>He who had thus fallen, was one for whom every eye had a tear
and every heart a genuine sigh; he had been the friend of all,
the enemy of none; he was young, beautiful, and brave; and his
native town had looked up to him as one who was to add new glory
to her venerable name, and new lustre to his own princely blood;
and cut off in the beginning of his career, the very high day of
his happiness and beauty, and so cut off&mdash;who was there that
did not lament for John de la Pole?&nbsp; But, though all
Winchester, and the county in whose bosom it lies, sorrowed over
the corpse of John de la Pole, the agony born from his death was
to be found in his family alone; there he had been adored, and
there most truly and deeply was his sad destiny accused.&nbsp;
His young and lovely wife, scarce past her bridal year,&mdash;she
who had, long before his marriage, been the secret object of his
ardent love, and who, <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>upon the death of his father, became
the object of his choice&mdash;of her grief it was scarcely
possible to think without affright; for, in that convulsion of
soul into which, in the first horror of eternal separation from
all we love, we invariably fall, she had withdrawn herself from
all consolation of her friends&mdash;all succour of her
attendants; and report whispered that she was using means, though
quietly, (in order to avoid public shame,) to shorten a life
which was now become odious and burthensome.&nbsp; To this cruel
resolution she had been driven by a terrible incident: on the
morning of the discovery of the body, she had, believing him to
be on his road towards his home, ascended her carriage in order
to meet him, and was driving cheerfully through the town, when
her progress was arrested by the appearance of the crowd bearing
the corpse of her husband.&nbsp; She recognised it at a glance,
and, before they were aware of their imprudence, a piercing
shriek announced to the people that she did so.&nbsp; She took
another searching, distracted look at the body, and shrunk into
the arms of her attendants, insensible and silent.&nbsp;
<i>They</i> thought she was dead&mdash;it would not have been
wonderful if she had been; the husband of her soul was lying
before her, a deep gash across his throat, another <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>had
disfigured his snowy brow, and almost divided his once lofty
head, while the bosom upon which she had been accustomed to
repose was mangled and rent by stabs and blows too many to
number&mdash;what an object for a young and loving wife!&nbsp;
Remembrance was terrible to her, and the inability of justice to
discover the murderer added despair to her grief, and thus
compelled her to seek for consolation only in the prospect of
death.</p>
<p>As bitter a grief, though perhaps not so deep or desperate,
had fastened upon the heart of the only survivor of his family, a
youth of twenty, of a beauty and virtue equal to his lamented
brother, and who had indeed ample reason for his regrets.&nbsp;
John de la Pole had been as a father to his youth, and loved him
with a warmth far surpassing the kindness of ordinary
brotherhood.&nbsp; Eustace had never been taught to remember that
he was the younger, for the fortunes of his house were open to
him, and the purse of the elder was common to both.&nbsp; On the
marriage of the latter with his beloved Agatha, the younger had
timidly hinted at his fears of an interruption to their
friendship; but John had remedied this, by generously providing
for his brother, and entreating his Agatha to allow him still a
home at the castle: which <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>being granted, Eustace, though still
fearful of the influence of his lovely sister, continued to
reside at home.</p>
<p>But the influence he so much dreaded during his life, became
singularly apparent after the death of his beloved John.&nbsp;
The will of the latter had indeed left an independence to
Eustace, but nothing to support the splendour of that princely
house of which he was now sole representative.&nbsp; All was
assigned to Agatha,&mdash;she was the sole heir of her
husband,&mdash;the being for whose sake alone he appeared to
glory in the possession of wealth.&nbsp; Eustace indeed might
still enjoy it, but it was upon a condition which drew the blood
from the young man&rsquo;s cheek as he read, and palsied the warm
throbbings of the heart in his bosom; it was, that if John de la
Pole should die childless before he had attained the age of
thirty, Eustace should espouse his widow.&nbsp; His brother even
<i>entreated</i> this sacrifice of him: he said, he knew his
heart had been sensible of other charms, but he implored him to
yield up this transient gratification to his eternal
happiness.&nbsp; He could not endure, he said, the thought of
averting from Eustace the fortune of his house; yet still less
could he endure to know that Agatha would fill a subordinate
state in his family to that in which <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>he had placed her.&nbsp; He
shuddered at the thought of her being driven, by this
circumstance, to become the wife of another&mdash;of one who
would love her, and whom she could also love.&nbsp; He besought
Eustace therefore, if he valued his repose, to wed her, as no
attachment subsisted between them, and he was satisfied to
believe that by him she would be treated with gentleness.&nbsp;
Agatha he entreated to comply with his last wishes, and accept
the hand of Eustace within two months after his death, or be
content to resign, with her present rank, the estates to the next
of kin.&nbsp; Such was the will of John de la Pole.&nbsp;
Eustace, full of grief, instantly retired from the castle of his
sister, whom he believed as little inclined to fulfil the
conditions of the will as himself, and resigned his spirit for
some days to despair; but his friends rallied round him, and
represented how much depended upon his calm decision.&nbsp; The
next of kin had appeared too, a greedy rapacious man, the son of
his father&rsquo;s sister, who seemed to be sure of his
inheritance, and whom John, (it was conjectured,) had purposely
named, to stimulate his brother to fulfil his dying
injunctions.&nbsp; Hugh de Broke was insolent and brutal, had
never been upon kindly terms with his cousins, and had once
nearly been <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>murdered by the peasantry for wounding John in a
quarrel which occurred a few years before.&nbsp; The inhabitants
saw him return with disgust; his early brutalities were
remembered; and when he boasted, in his drink, that he knew his
cousin before his death intended to make a will in his favour,
all Hampshire was ready to accuse him of the murder, and many of
its gentlemen would have given half their estates to have been
able to substantiate the charge.&nbsp; From earnest desire to
action there is but one step: the thought was scarcely uttered by
one, ere many endeavoured to prove it a fact, and Hugh de Broke
became, from an object of mere dislike, one of abhorrence and
suspicion.&nbsp; He was not told of the murmurs afloat respecting
him; and he was too much accustomed to signs of dislike, to
observe any thing new in their conduct.&nbsp; The eyes that
glared upon him had nothing in them peculiarly ferocious to him
now; nor did the deep mutterings and suppressed curses as he
passed, startle him at this period from his path; he remembered
the hatred of other days, and if he <i>did</i> observe any
increase of this ill feeling towards him, he attributed their
malignity less towards himself in his own person, than against
the authority he would be enabled to hold over their actions as
the fortunate heir of <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>John de la Pole.&nbsp; At all
events, he fortified himself against their inflictions, by
resorting in some cases to the exercise of his native brutality,
in others to a loud and bitter scorn, which only served to
increase their abhorrence and his own unsuspected danger.</p>
<p>The accusers were wary in their proceedings, and silently went
on collecting proofs and accumulating evidence, until they
believed they had truly in the ruffian kinsman, discovered the
murderer of their popular favourite.&nbsp; It was remembered,
that after three years&rsquo; absence, he had appeared in
Hampshire about a month previous to the murder of John, and then
had suddenly disappeared, to re-appear as suddenly in Winchester
after the contents of the extraordinary will were made
public.&nbsp; He had boasted a previous knowledge of this
document, and he had taken into his service the man who attended
John in his fatal journey, and who, by delaying to follow his
master, had given courage to the assassin to make the
attack.&nbsp; This man had been dismissed by Eustace with a
bitter reproof, and had immediately repaired to De Broke.&nbsp;
Fear, or too much security, (it was affirmed,) had dictated the
measure of his adoption, after a dismissal which ought to have
rendered his services every where <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>suspicious.&nbsp; John, it was
urged, had been absent nearly a month, on a visit to a distant
friend; he had set out on foot on his return, unaccompanied; for
this man, according to his own statement, was commanded by his
master to follow him with the horses, one of which (De la
Pole&rsquo;s) had been injured by an accident a few days before;
but he had loitered long after, in order to keep an appointment
which he had made with a damsel in the establishment of his
master&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; He was for this loudly accused of
treachery; and De Broke ferociously became his champion, with a
violence that only defeated the object he had in view.&nbsp; The
lock of hair found in the gripe of the corpse was remembered and
produced; it was a bunch of thick and clustering curls, and had
been forcibly torn from the head of the assassin.&nbsp; The hair
of the servant was pale, but it was remarked that Hugh&rsquo;s
was dark and curling, and they sought an opportunity to compare
them together.&nbsp; De Broke drove the party from his presence
with every mark of contempt, and hardly deigned to assent to the
repeated asseverations of his servants, that his hair was much
darker, and altogether of a different texture from that produced
as taken from the corpse.&nbsp; His conduct was resented
warmly.&nbsp; By degrees all the <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>gentry assumed the opinions of the
mob; and when, in a violent attack upon his person, it was
discovered that his hair had lately been polled in order to
facilitate the cure of a wound, and which had hitherto been
concealed by the (then) extraordinary contrivance of a peruke,
the magistrates made open cause with the people, and Hugh was
conducted to prison.&nbsp; There his conduct was sullen and
brutal; he would give no explanation, save that the wound in his
head arose from a fall from his horse.&nbsp; He was unusually
ferocious; and considerably aggravated his case, by his constant
threats of deep and deadly vengeance against Eustace de la Pole,
who, he insisted, had conspired to cheat him of his estate, in
conjunction with his other enemies.&nbsp; Many new proofs
appeared against him, and the whole county awaited, in trembling
suspense, the event of his anticipated trial.</p>
<p>But these anticipations were not to be gratified: a few nights
before the arrival of the judges, Hugh had contrived to escape
from his prison, and elude the vigilance of his enemies, by the
aid, it was supposed, of his servant, for he also fled the
country; and neither master nor man again fell into the hands of
justice.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the interval months, the <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>short
period of time allowed for most important considerations, were
fast wearing away; the two persons most interested in their
progress had come to no decision; and though Hugh de Broke had
for the present withdrawn his claim, yet he had heirs, who,
neither more delicate nor more generous than himself, might
endeavour to prove his incapacity, and substantiate their own in
place of his.&nbsp; At all events, delays were dangerous, and the
fortunes of De la Pole were too considerable to be put to
hazard.&nbsp; Eustace loved another, and Agatha could not forget
her husband; yet a compliance with the terms of the will became
an absolute necessity.&nbsp; Though with averted hearts, they
joined hands at the earnest entreaty of friends and relatives;
nor would it have been possible to have refused, since even royal
majesty evinced a solicitude, that the great fortunes and
powerful political interest of the family should not pass into
any other hands than those of that loyal and princely blood which
had hitherto held them so nobly.&nbsp; Agatha and Eustace became
man and wife, and vowed to cherish and love each other till
death.</p>
<p>But it was soon evident to all, that this was not either in
the power or inclination of the new wedded pair: a deeper sorrow
had sunk into <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>their minds, and their calm grief was supplanted by
looks and feelings of horror and despair.&nbsp; They spent much
of their time together; but their conferences seemed rather to
heighten than to soothe their mutual suffering.&nbsp; It was at
length remarked, that Eustace never passed his nights in the
chamber of his wife, but sometimes in deep groans and anguish in
the seclusion of his own apartment, or in wandering wildly
through the gloomy mazes of the forest.&nbsp; At such times a
stupor would overshadow the spirit of Agatha,&mdash;a silent and
uncomplaining madness that seemed to render her insensible to
suffering; and only upon his return did she vent her keen anguish
in words, or dissipate her torture by shrieks as piercing as they
were fearful.</p>
<p>Those about them saw no other cause for this mental hell, than
the grief which had seized upon them, by constantly contemplating
their eternal separation from the being they most loved.&nbsp; It
was anticipated that time would effect, if not a cure, at least
some amelioration of its bitterness; but time rolled on, and
their agonies did not decrease.&nbsp; Nor did the prospect of an
heir to their disastrous union afford any pleasure or consolation
to their minds; they went through the usual routine of
preparation, because, as it <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>appeared, it <i>was</i> usual; there
was no joyous anticipation on the part of Eustace,&mdash;no
tender, trembling hope on the side of Agatha; there was no
anxiety, no care; it was a thing unspoken of, unnoted; and when
the bustle of the house, the importance of the attendants, and
the entrance of the friend, (who, unsummoned, save by the
servants, yet judged it necessary to be near her,) told Eustace
of the near approaching throes of Agatha, he threw himself upon
the ground in the chamber adjoining her, and buried his face in
his hands.</p>
<p>Eustace, young, beautiful, and of a gallant spirit, was adored
by his household, <i>all</i> the members of which fondly
contemplated the birth of an heir, as an event well calculated to
calm their mutual suffering, and endear them to each other: and
though the maternal anguish of Agatha took place before the usual
and expected time, the hopes so affectionately cherished were not
shaken by the event; but the conduct of their master gave a wound
to their generous devotion.&nbsp; Sad and singular as it was,
that of Agatha was scarcely less inexplicable: no groans, no
tokens of pain accompanied her physical suffering; and it was
apparent that some keener pang of the mind, some woe too deep for
utterance, had deadened all <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>sense to merely corporal pain.&nbsp;
Her eyes were generally closed, except when some louder noise, or
the nearer approach of an attendant towards the couch, forced her
to open them, and gaze around her for an instant; but, when her
senses were thus for a moment awakened, it was evident the object
which had aroused them had no share in their attention.&nbsp;
Heedless of all that was passing, she took a shuddering rapid
glance around the chamber, as if in earnest search of one whom
she yet feared to encounter, and then closed them in evident
affright, and sunk anew into stupor and silence;&mdash;it was
amidst this stupor and silence that her first-born son entered
the world.</p>
<p>Eustace had not long remained absorbed in his own painful
meditations, ere a mighty shriek from the chamber of Agatha broke
upon his ear, and made him partly raise his head from the hard
pillow to which he had consigned it.&nbsp; But his soul was dead
within him;&mdash;he thought no further agony could reach him
now&mdash;no keener pang could inflict a wound in his already
crushed heart; and though the scream was one of horror and
dismay, a sound of many voices in grief and consternation, it
passed over his senses without further notice, and he again
drooped his head to the ground, and, grovelling to earth, seemed
as he <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>would bury himself from his anguish in the kindly bosom
of his only parent&mdash;his last&mdash;his truest friend.</p>
<p>But repose was not for him&mdash;no, not even the repose of
despair&mdash;he was again to wake, to feel, to suffer; there was
an undreamed of agony near&mdash;a sting that was to penetrate
his palsied bosom, and awake his crushed soul from the dead; to
die would have been bliss, but that was a bliss denied him.</p>
<p>The unhappy young man arose;&mdash;a footstep was heard
hastily rushing towards his chamber&mdash;the wife of Courtenay
approached him with a look of commiserating regard, and took his
arm to draw him to the apartment of Agatha.&nbsp; She did not
speak, but Eustace read in the expression of her features that
there was yet more to encounter and to endure.&nbsp; He entered
the apartment of his wife&mdash;<i>she</i> was lying speechless
and insensible upon her couch, utterly incapable of any
observation of what was passing around her; and by her side lay a
deformed and distorted infant, plunged in the still deeper
silence of death.</p>
<p>In the first moment of sorrow, the friend who had so hastily
sought the presence of Eustace, had done so under the compelling
influence of the <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>circumstance and the time; but a few moments had
scarcely elapsed, ere Courtenay recovered sufficient recollection
to decide that his wife had judged unwisely in so rapidly flying
from the chamber of the poor Agatha, and bursting into that of
her husband, dreading the influence the sudden grief might
probably acquire over the already racked brain of the
latter.&nbsp; With this feeling, Courtenay raised his eye from
the dead child to observe the countenance of Eustace, and, if
possible, form a judgment as to how he was likely to support this
shock: but here his fears gave place to a new feeling, and his
grief was overpowered by astonishment at the singular deportment
of Eustace: the childless father advanced slowly towards the
corse of his infant, and gazed upon it intently for a moment; a
spasm of agony passed over his countenance, but there was no
surprise mingled with its expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;And is it
indeed <i>thus</i>!&rdquo; he murmured in a low and agonised tone
of voice; &ldquo;and <i>so</i> must my punishment
begin!&mdash;yet better is it even thus, than that thou, poor
distorted thing! shouldst live to reproach thy father, and, by
thy sufferings, be an accusing witness against him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A convulsive shivering seized upon his frame, and he seemed to <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>be
struggling with some difficult and awful resolve.&nbsp; At that
moment a similar convulsion appeared to extend itself to the body
of the infant; its eyes rolled, and one arm suddenly stretched
itself out with a convulsive kind of movement, and remained
extended, pointing towards Eustace.&nbsp; The struggle was at an
end in an instant; the change from distracted to subdued sorrow
was the work of a moment.&nbsp; He grew perfectly calm; and
turning his looks again towards the infant, and addressing it in
a low steady voice, &ldquo;I thank thee,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;for this warning; thou too shalt not have cause to
reproach me; I have hesitated too long; but His will and thine
shall be done.&rdquo;&nbsp; Saying thus, his head drooped upon
his bosom as in deep thought, and the extended arm of the child a
moment after fell quietly down by its side.</p>
<p>Courtenay, the friend of Eustace, and the near relative of
Agatha, now judged that in this moment of calmness, he might
venture some expressions of consolation.&nbsp; He deeply
regretted that he should have mistaken the sleep of the infant
for the last slumber of death, and he urged to Eustace the
possibility that the union of medical skill and paternal care
might relieve <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>his child from its afflictions, and restore it, in
natural beauty, to his love.&nbsp; He continued to dwell some
time longer upon well intended topics of consolation, until he
perceived that Eustace no longer heard his observations, or even
remembered his presence.&nbsp; Suddenly, a new thought appeared
to awaken the dormant faculties of the latter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has
Agatha seen her child?&rdquo; he demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the wife of Courtenay; &ldquo;she was
insensible at the time of its birth, and I instantly rushed from
the chamber to seek counsel of my husband: he could give none;
but, terrified as myself, followed me hither.&nbsp; Now, I deem,
that as the child has uttered no sound since it came into the
world, it were better she were told of its death; it will be but
an anticipation of what must happen; for surely such an unhappy
object cannot long exist.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know not
that,&rdquo; observed Eustace, sadly; &ldquo;but at least do as
thou hast said, and remove the child from the
castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Courtenay retired from the apartment; and
the wish of De la Pole was speedily obeyed.</p>
<p>But it seemed as if this unmeasured sorrow had brought
calmness to him whom they feared it would annihilate: he sought
not the apartment of <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>his wife, but retired tranquilly to
his own; and there was a stillness in it throughout the night,
wholly unlike the restless pacings and disturbed groans which had
hitherto been heard to issue from it.&nbsp; In the morning he
went to Agatha: their conference was long and sad, for traces of
tears were on her countenance when they parted; but the shrieks
and agonies which had formerly distinguished their interviews
were no more; she had caught consolation and fortitude from him,
and her mind, it appeared, had now grown as resigned and tranquil
as his own.</p>
<p>Eustace made a journey to a distant part of the country: he
spoke nothing of his intention previous to his setting out, nor
of its object on his return; that it had been of importance,
could only be collected from the care with which he had concealed
it, and the continual occupations which followed his arrival at
Winchester.&nbsp; He was constantly employed in writing, and once
or twice had had earnest conversations with Courtenay.&nbsp; It
was during one of these that he received an unexpected
interruption in the person of Agatha, who entered calmly the
apartment of her husband, and demanded his attention.&nbsp;
Courtenay arose, and was preparing to retire, when Agatha
arrested his <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>steps.&nbsp; &ldquo;That which I have to say is for thy
ear also,&rdquo; she remarked; &ldquo;stay, therefore, and answer
me.&nbsp; Sleeping on my couch in the midday heat, the voices of
my damsels in discourse broke upon my ear, and the sound they
uttered gave me to know that my infant boy yet lives; wherefore
is it that it is not in the bosom of its mother? and why was it
ever banished from her care?&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a dead
silence at the conclusion of this speech.&nbsp; Eustace replied
not, and the lip of Courtenay trembled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eustace
fears to reply,&rdquo; observed Agatha; &ldquo;he trembles to
accumulate more sorrow upon this drooping head; he may, in
tenderness, deceive; but thou, Courtenay, knowest not to lie, and
from thy lip must the bitter truth come; wherefore is my infant
not here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We feared it would die,&rdquo;
answered Courtenay; &ldquo;and, therefore, in thy already
terrible agony, wished to spare thee the spectacle of its
dissolution.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But it did not die,&rdquo;
pertinaciously resumed Agatha; &ldquo;why was it not restored? it
might have brought peace and consolation to the bosom of its
mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; returned the
shuddering speaker; &ldquo;that child would have brought sorrow
and dismay, but no joy to the heart of its unhappy parent.&nbsp;
We removed it to a distance, <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>fearing the effect of its appearance
upon your mind; it is most fearfully disfigured.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Disfigured!&rdquo; repeated Agatha, with a thrilling
start.&nbsp; A long pause ensued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let her behold the
boy,&rdquo; said Eustace, calmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes! let me behold
my boy,&rdquo; said the mother, while tears of sorrow heightened
the lustre of those splendid eyes; &ldquo;let me behold my boy; I
shall not shrink from his sight, even though he be an eternal
remembrancer of&rdquo;&mdash;She paused, and sadly turned her
eyes towards her husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then, thou hast
anticipated aright,&rdquo; said Eustace; &ldquo;he <i>will</i> be
to thee an eternal remembrancer; to me&mdash;that ghastly
face:&mdash;that pointing hand&mdash;I will not behold them; yet
do I rejoice in thy resolve, for such is thy painful duty, and
thus wilt thou share my sacrifice without enduring my
suffering.&rdquo;&nbsp; He retired as he spoke; and soon after,
conducted by Courtenay, in silence and secrecy, the hapless
mother folded the ghastly boy to her breast.</p>
<p>It is rare that the human mind can dwell upon more than one
wonder at a period.&nbsp; The neighbourhood, roused by the idle
gossiping of the castle damsels, had begun to be astonished at
the disappearance of the heir of De la Pole, who <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>was said
not to be dead, but deprived of his mother&rsquo;s tenderness and
his father&rsquo;s succession; and, offended that there should be
a secret, they determined that rendering justice to the injured
child should be the apology for their own ungenerous
curiosity.&nbsp; From this they were diverted by a singular
incident.</p>
<p>A meeting of the gentlemen of the county had been called for
some public purpose foreign to this narrative.&nbsp; In the midst
of this discussion, it was observed that Eustace de la Pole was
absent: this, to many who had known of his recent griefs and
habits, was nothing singular; but those who resided more remote
from the sphere of his influence, felt authorised to demand his
presence and attention in a matter which was supposed deeply to
interest the class to which he belonged.&nbsp; A messenger was
despatched to request his attendance, and was told that he was
preparing to wait upon them; and he who was charged with the
embassy had scarcely returned to his employers, ere Eustace de la
Pole entered the council-chamber, leading by the hand a tall and
graceful youth, whom he placed at the table of the council, and
behind whose chair he stood while he spoke.&nbsp; His words were
few; but their stunning import threw horror and astonishment over
the noble assembly.&nbsp; <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>&ldquo;I present to you this young
man,&rdquo; calmly said he; &ldquo;and I have assigned to him his
appointed place; mine it must be no longer; he is the son of Hugh
de Broke, who is lately dead, and who, a few months since, was
accused of the murder of John de la Pole.&nbsp; I come to render
him a late, though, I trust, not useless justice, and restore the
honour of his house.&nbsp; This youth is not only the heir of the
fortunes of De la Pole, but of his father&rsquo;s innocence,
since I only was the murderer of my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would not be possible to paint all the feelings of the
audience who listened to this singular declaration, nor the
contrariety of opinions that pervaded the minds of men upon its
disclosure.&nbsp; Some asserted that derangement had fastened
upon the mind of Eustace, and that he only imagined the fact;
others, that grief had wearied him of existence, and that,
preferring to die by other hands than his own, he had chosen this
method of escaping from life and its convulsions; but the far
greater part (as is ever the case in human judgments) decided for
the darker side of the question, and concluded the
self-accusation to be just, and were only now interested in
analysing his motive.&nbsp; The will of the victim too became a
subject of infinite wonder; and when, to <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>every
interrogatory (save those which implied the participation of
Agatha, which he instantly and earnestly denied,) Eustace
remained mute, indignation supplied the place of pity; and among
those who had been his intimates and friends, had eaten of his
bread and drank of his cup, there were not wanting some, who,
baffled in their eager pursuit of the marvellous, and offended
that a secret was denied to them, even hinted at the torture, as
a means of compelling a discovery of his motives and
accomplices.</p>
<p>There are many whose sickly existences find health only in the
contemplation of the severer agonies of others; many who, without
either hatred or malignity, yet love to feed their unnatural and
craving appetites for singularities and horrors; and would rather
cherish them with the blood of a dear friend, than suffer them to
famish for want of sustenance.&nbsp; In small communities and
country places, this inclination in the inhabitants is most
apparent: here it was cruelly visible.&nbsp; John de la Pole had
always been a popular man, and his destiny had afforded them a
feast of blood, for which they felt grateful to his memory; from
his murderer they could exact it, and they would: the loudest for
justice appealed to the king for the application of the torture,
and those <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>who pitied the sufferer did not oppose the petition, as
curious to behold the result.</p>
<p>The weak and inquisitive prince who then filled the English
throne, saw something singular and mysterious in the conduct of
the young De la Pole, and therefore unhesitatingly gave his
assent to the sentence of his judges.&nbsp; The torture was borne
by Eustace without a groan, though a close imprisonment of some
weeks might have weakened his spirit and exhausted his bodily
strength.&nbsp; He walked calmly and unsupported to the scene of
suffering, conversing steadily with Courtenay, who never for an
instant forsook him.&nbsp; From any outward tokens of anticipated
agony or terror, it would have been difficult to distinguish the
criminal from the spectator: he even smiled as he recognised his
acquaintances in the crowd assembled to gaze upon his
sufferings.&nbsp; There was only one action remarkable in his
bearing at this trying juncture; on ascending the scaffold, and
while they were binding his arms, his attention was arrested
apparently by some object near him, though no one could be seen
by the crowd, and during the whole period of the infliction of
the &ldquo;peine forte et dure,&rdquo; the victim kept his eyes
still fastened upon this spot, but without articulating a
word.&nbsp; When the accumulated weights <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>pressed so
heavily on his sinking breast as to threaten dissolution, he
raised his head to look upon his mangled limbs, and surveyed them
in silent attention; he then turned his eyes to the spot which
had so long occupied their regards, and, pointing with a slow and
solemn motion to the load upon his breast, said, in a clear and
steady tone, &ldquo;Thou see&rsquo;st!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eustace was remanded to prison; his friends, his enemies,
those who were neither, all besought him with equal earnestness
not to die with this secret sin upon his heart; he smiled at
their anxiety, but answered nothing to their queries;&mdash;they
doubted his guilt, ascribed his conduct to madness, to
despair;&mdash;he replied by throwing off his cap and shewing the
scar in his head, from which his brother, in the last agonising
grasp of death, had torn the dark and bloody lock which had once
so nearly condemned the unfortunate De Broke,&mdash;and they were
silenced.&nbsp; He continued steadfast to his
purpose&mdash;silent, sorrowful, but calm.</p>
<p>And where was Agatha during these scenes of insult and
endurance?&nbsp; Had she too forsaken the dungeon of her husband,
and given up her soul to exultation in his captivity and
anguish?&nbsp; She had once, and only once, demanded admittance
<a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>to his
prison; she had remained with him many hours, and retired, like
himself, tranquillised from the interview.&nbsp; Soon after, she
formally resigned the castle and its dependencies to him whom
Eustace had named as the lawful heir: her own son, and his
claims, were now no longer remembered, since the crime of his
father had deprived him of the succession, which had been awarded
by the king to the son of the injured De Broke.&nbsp; After these
arrangements, which were performed in silence and celerity, and
with only the casual assistance of Courtenay, Agatha withdrew
from her native town, and concealed her person and her sorrow for
ever from the eyes of the world.</p>
<p>But her desertion of her husband at the tremendous juncture
when he so much needed her help and consolation, was not regarded
with indignation by the many who considered the circumstances
under which she stood: <i>that</i> husband was a murderer, and of
whom?&nbsp; The terrible question needed no reply, and Agatha was
speedily acquitted; her absence too was a trivial circumstance
compared with that of her husband&rsquo;s situation.&nbsp; All
eyes were turned to the prison at Winchester.</p>
<p>At length Eustace de la Pole was led out to <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>die.&nbsp;
It was a splendid day, in the season of autumn, on which his
mortal career was to terminate.&nbsp; Consideration for the
princely blood which flowed in his veins, had forbidden, in his
case, the strangulation by the degrading cord, and the axe and
the block had been substituted in its room.&nbsp; The novelty of
the circumstance drew many thousands round the scaffold, who
awaited, in feverish and almost angry impatience, the arrival of
him who was to furnish forth the spectacle of the day.&nbsp; He
came,&mdash;not indeed as before, with an erect and unassisted
step, for his limbs had been crushed, and his physical strength
destroyed; but his pale countenance was composed, and his soft
rich voice was steady and clear, as he conversed at intervals
with Courtenay, the priest, and the executioner, who received him
courteously, as, led by the two former, he ascended the steps to
the scaffold.&nbsp; Of the crowd around he took no heed, but with
calm and silent celerity prepared himself for the block.&nbsp; At
sight of the noble young man, bare-headed and disrobed for a sad
and ignominious death, there were many who could no longer
restrain their tears; and hard-hearted grey-headed men who,
hating his crime, believed they could find pleasure in his
sorrow, and went thither to feast upon his suffering, <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>now wept
loudly for him whom, in their first feeling of horror, they had
cursed.&nbsp; He appeared unconscious of this change of temper,
and seemed rather disposed to hasten than to retard the
preparations, for he laid his head down upon his last pillow
before the executioner had entirely completed them.&nbsp; He had
himself promised to give the signal for the fall of the axe; and
while the multitude were anxiously awaiting this movement, they
beheld him suddenly raise his head from the block, and gaze
intently upon one particular spot upon the scaffold; all eyes
were instantly directed towards it, but to them at least no
object was visible.&nbsp; He gazed for a few moments with intense
earnestness, then calmly replacing his head upon the block,
exclaimed in solemn but eager accents, &ldquo;Thou
see&rsquo;st!&rdquo; and gave the signal for his death.&nbsp; The
axe fell&mdash;heavily, rapidly&mdash;it was over&mdash;swifter
than thought.&nbsp; The executioner held up the gory head to the
people; the features were calm, the eyes closed; but before he
could utter the customary sentence, they had once more opened and
fixed themselves upon the same spot which had attracted the last
of their living regards; they appeared slowly to follow the
movement of some unseen object round the scaffold, till they

197</span>the opposite side; then they withdrew their gaze,
quivered for an instant, dropped, dark and immoveable, for
ever.</p>
<p>This, as many strange scenes, was however doomed to be
forgotten, like other things.&nbsp; Ten years passed away, and
ten other wonders had, during that period, interested or
frightened the people of Winchester and its surrounding
country.&nbsp; John and Eustace de la Pole were no more
remembered, or their story only casually mentioned as belonging
to the odd things that were; Courtenay had glided into middle
age, and the youth for whom Eustace had done so much, had long
since written man.&mdash;Ten years!&nbsp; How many and how
striking may be the changes of ten years!&nbsp; Courtenay had
long pondered over the destiny of Agatha, and sighed to think
whither her unhappy fate might have conducted her; but the long
interval which passed had almost swept her from his mind, when a
letter, in her unforgotten character, was one day put into his
hand.&nbsp; It was couched in brief and anxious terms, and
conveyed a request that he would immediately proceed to her
dwelling.&nbsp; Courtenay was no laggard in the cause of
humanity; he did not pause to speculate upon this address, or
even to wonder at its abruptness, but he set forward instantly,
<a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>and the
morning of the following day saw him knock at a lonely cottage on
the coast of Dorsetshire, in the neighbourhood of Corfe
Castle.&nbsp; The door was opened by Agatha herself, who, habited
in the black robes which she had worn since the sad death of the
last of her husbands, received him with courteous sadness.&nbsp;
Years had not dimmed the beauty of her matchless face, but sorrow
had been busy with its expression; the same lovely features were
there, but their once bright character was gone.</p>
<p>Their meeting was tenderly sorrowful: Agatha said little in
explanation until she had conducted her guest into an adjoining
chamber, and pointed out one object for his observation.&nbsp;
Stretched upon a couch, grown to boyhood, covered with wounds,
and unchanged in person, save that his deformities had now grown
more manifest, lay extended the ghastly boy, the only child of
Agatha and the hapless Eustace.&nbsp; Courtenay trembled as he
gazed; but the mother&rsquo;s looks were calm.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
dead,&rdquo; she said, on observing the emotion of her guest;
&ldquo;what Heaven and Nature with so much difficulty spared, the
brutality of man has destroyed; he was my joy and sorrow, and
many a weary hour have I watched to snatch him from the yawning
<a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>grave:
for ten years he has been my sole care; and for the insults and
scorn heaped upon his deformed and idiotic existence, he found
compensation in the tenderness of his mother.&nbsp; The small
pittance which I derived from my father was sufficient for our
wants: and never should I have called upon any former friend, but
for the cruel deed of yesterday; robbers from the waters broke
into my poor dwelling, and pillaged thence my property.&nbsp; I
knew not how it was; I had gone to a distance to buy food, and on
my return found the poor idiot thus.&nbsp; My only attendant, an
old woman, had been wounded in his defence; and from her I with
difficulty learned, that the convulsive movements of the boy, and
his pointing hand, as his menacing eye followed their actions,
had drawn upon him their wrath and its brutal consequences.&nbsp;
I am averse from again appearing in the scenes which I have once
and for ever abandoned, and therefore I sent for thee, Courtenay,
to spare myself the sad task of interring the pale corpse of my
boy, and drawing wondering and inquisitive eyes upon my person
and history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtenay was pleased with the confidence reposed in his
friendship.&nbsp; A brother&rsquo;s love might have done less for
Agatha; it could not have <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>effected more.&nbsp; Her wishes were
immediately performed; and he was preparing, with unintrusive
delicacy, to return to his home, when Agatha for a few moments
detained him; &ldquo;You have deserved unlimited confidence at my
hands;&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and you shall obtain it: he who is
now numbered with the ignominious dead desired it should be so,
and I withhold it no longer.&nbsp; You, in common with all the
world, were ignorant of the motives which impelled the unhappy
Eustace to the deed which he perpetrated; but you did not, in
common with all the world, forsake him in his utmost need: for
you he drew up the story of his sorrows, and placed it in my
hands to be given to you only when I saw the fitting time; that
time hath arrived.&nbsp; The child of sorrow is dead, and I shall
still more completely retire from a world where insignificance
and poverty are no protection from cruelty and avarice; a convent
will shortly receive me, and, if I continue to live, a newer and
better existence will be mine: if not, I shall have done wisely
in thus obeying the last command of Eustace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtenay received the packet and retired; he lingered not a
moment to relieve the recluse of his presence, but returned to
Winchester, after receiving her commands to see her again in
three <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>days; he then hastened to his apartment, and, with
trembling avidity, read, in the confessions of Eustace, the
secret story of the fortunes of De la Pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that thou despisest me, Courtenay; I know that
thou deemest me no less a fool than a coward; thou didst bring me
the means of an honourable death, gavest into mine hands the
dagger and the drug, and I have rejected both: we disputed,
differed, parted, met again, and again renewed the subject: thou
didst even deign to persuade the coward (so thou thoughtest him)
to act like a man; but thy entreaties were unheeded and thy
counsel rejected; he will die like a thief and a
criminal&mdash;he will be hooted out of life; and curses will be
the torches to give light to his memory, that it sink not into
darkness and oblivion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said I not that I was a sacrifice? that my punishment
was a propitiatory offering?&nbsp; Now again I say to thee the
same thing.&nbsp; Death would have few horrors for me (for it is
a thing I covet) without the ignominy of a public execution; to
offer my life for my wrong would be nothing, but to offer it up
thus!&mdash;This alone can satisfy immortal justice; this alone
can satisfy <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>the spirit of the murdered man.&nbsp; Read and behold
my meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou knowest how fondly, contrary to his father&rsquo;s
hope, John de la Pole loved the beautiful daughter of Philip
Forester, thy kinsman; but thou knowest not how much more
fervently she was adored by the wretched Eustace, and how
tenderly the gentle Agatha returned that love.&nbsp; Hope there
was none; for what had I to bribe the greedy father of my love,
when John de la Pole could hereafter lay the fortunes of his
house at her feet?&nbsp; Philip suspected the state of his
daughter&rsquo;s heart, and had looked deeper than I imagined
into mine: he determined that a younger brother was not deserving
of his Agatha&rsquo;s beauty, and, by cold civilities and hints
of my father&rsquo;s and brother&rsquo;s disapprobation, banished
me from his house.&nbsp; One thing alone gave consolation to my
blighted heart, the steadiness with which my father resolved
against the marriage of John with the object of our mutual
passion.&nbsp; In one of the sad conferences which I
occasionally, though now but seldom, held with my beloved Agatha,
it occurred to my imagination, that though my father had resolved
to dispose differently of the heir of his house, he might not
object <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>to my union with the object of my choice; and I
received permission of my beloved to make the attempt upon his
feelings.&nbsp; I did so immediately, and, with a rapture which I
dare not now dwell upon, received his permission, and his solemn
promise to purchase the approbation of the selfish Forester, by
bestowing upon me one-fourth of his more than princely
fortune.&nbsp; He arranged to see Forester upon the following
day: the same evening I flew to Agatha.&nbsp; O Courtenay! didst
thou ever love?&nbsp; Those few blessed hours were the most happy
of my life, and the last that were so.&nbsp; We parted; Agatha
radiant with happiness; I, to think, to hope, to anticipate, to
wish all things could share my transports, to love creation, to
love God.&nbsp; In the morning my father was found dead on his
couch; and the following month Agatha became the wife of my
brother!&nbsp; Courtenay! didst thou ever love?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wilt ask, where was Eustace when his beloved was
thus sacrificed?&nbsp; Alas! sent to a distance, to execute some
commands of that brother upon whom I was now so utterly
dependent.&nbsp; He had discovered my love, and thus, without my
suspecting his intentions, prevented its consequences: he
hastened to Agatha, represented the ruin she would bring upon me,
and his determination <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>to abandon me for ever, unless she
became his wife; Forester, who was his ally, threatened her with
his curse; I know not all the artifices used,&mdash;I never could
listen to the detail.&nbsp; She became the wife of the man she
could not love, and I was suffered to wither beneath his roof,
while, with calm hypocrisy, he told his own tale, ostentatiously
enriched his younger brother, and declared he could not live
happy without him.&nbsp; Fool that he was!&mdash;stupid,
uncalculating idiot!&nbsp; He had torn asunder two burning
hearts, and expected to smother their fires; he had separated two
devoted beings, compelled them to live in each other&rsquo;s
presence, and yet expected them to forget.&nbsp; Agatha abhorred
his sight&mdash;his very aspect was loathsome to her.&nbsp; I saw
her agonies,&mdash;I saw her daily shudderings at every
demonstration of his love; and cold dews of death spread over my
own heart when I beheld her submitting to his fondness.&nbsp; I
implored to be banished from the castle; I entreated to be
allowed the sad privilege of beholding Agatha no more: he could
not trust me from him, he said; and I was obliged to
remain.&nbsp; Merciless idiot! blind looker into the human
heart!&nbsp; Had he consented, all might then have been well; but
how did he dare thus selfishly sport with torture?&nbsp; He went
<a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>on a
journey for a few weeks; he commanded me to a distant part of the
country on business of importance to his interests: I went, but
returned ere half the allotted time for his absence had
expired&mdash;to be alone with Agatha&mdash;to see her
unrestrained&mdash;to mingle my tears with hers: I could not
resist this one sad bliss, and I hastened back to enjoy it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We met, the lover and the beloved, in grief&mdash;in
madness&mdash;in despair!&nbsp; Oh, wonder not, that when we
parted guilt should be added to the burthen of our sorrows; but
the terrible consciousness of crime changed at once our natures
and our deeds.&nbsp; Agatha&rsquo;s horror of her husband
increased: and, now that she was mine, I determined she should no
more be his&mdash;to fly, and rob the castle for the means of
sustenance.&nbsp; Alas! I feared to expose her to scorn, should
we be unable to evade the pursuit of justice; and, even if in
this we should succeed, what means had I of subsistence when that
slender source should fail, proscribed, as we should be, in every
part of our native land?&nbsp; To live on, as I had lately done,
was still more impossible; since Agatha herself had armed her
bosom with a knife to be turned against her heart rather than
again endure the horrors of her husband&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; Again
and <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>again we met in passionate, though gloomy conference;
and thus continued to waste the time in fruitless debate until
his messenger announced his approaching return.&nbsp; Despair
gave wings to my thought; Agatha&rsquo;s eye glanced on mine; she
drew the dagger from her breast, and I snatched it from her
hand.&nbsp; Our thoughts had spoken&mdash;there was no need of
words&mdash;we had understood each other without them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hastened to conceal myself in the New Forest, near
the road through which he must pass on his return.&nbsp; He had
taken his confidential servant with him, and, rather than expose
myself to observation, I had determined to fire at him through
the trees, calculating and believing that the servant would
mistake the attack for that of concealed robbers, and fly,
leaving his master to his fate.&nbsp; But I had scarcely arranged
my mode of attack ere I heard a footstep in the road; I looked
out, and beheld him slowly advancing, with his eyes steadfastly
directed towards the towers of his castle, as if he sought out
the apartment of his wife.&nbsp; At the sight of him all prudence
vanished&mdash;all recollection of the calm attack which I had
meditated passed away from my mind; I did not even observe that
he was alone: hatred and rage filled my heart, and I <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>rushed upon
him like a wild beast, tearing him to the earth by the bare
strength of sinew, and inflicting many mortal stabs upon his
breast: he grappled fiercely with me, struggled hard to rise, and
even drew his dagger, which I broke in his grasp before he could
strike one blow.&nbsp; He tore a lock of hair from my head, but,
during the terrible contest he had not uttered a single word,
till a deep and home-directed stroke upon his brow threw him
powerless on the sod, then he spoke gaspingly to his brother:
&lsquo;Have mercy upon me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;have mercy; I
have wronged thee, but that is not the heaviest of my crimes; I
would live to repent: to expiate one, the deepest, darkest, let
me live; I dare not die.&nbsp; My father!&mdash;I overheard his
arrangements with thee&mdash;I could not bear to lose
her&mdash;he was found dead on his couch&mdash;I smothered him in
the night.&nbsp; Mercy, mercy!&nbsp; O Eustace! let me
live,&mdash;I am not fit to die!&rsquo;&nbsp; But his words
raised a wilder fiend in my soul, that scared away the spirit of
mercy.&nbsp; He then had been the monster&mdash;he!&mdash;I raved
aloud, &lsquo;Murderer! thou art not fit to live&mdash;hell gapes
for thee&mdash;begone!&rsquo;&nbsp; I drew my dagger across his
throat; the blood gushed upon my face, upon my hands; he grinned,
scowled, gibbered as he sunk, but he spoke and struggled no
more.</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>&ldquo;I hastened home,&mdash;but I saw not Agatha,
neither did I seek her during the long and terrible night that
followed the sunset crime: I dared not tell her what I had done;
I could not have borne to hear her speak of the sin which I had
committed.&nbsp; Towards the morning I grew calm; my fears and
horror subsided; I thought of the atrocious act of the guilty
dead, and, by degrees, persuaded myself that I had done an act of
justice; I began to calculate upon the consequences, and
seriously consider whether, by this deed, I had really achieved
the consummation of my wishes&mdash;the possession of my adored
Agatha; she was my sister, the widow of my brother; could I
legally become her husband?&nbsp; And, allowing the possibility,
was it probable that I should be permitted to do so?&nbsp; These
considerations gave birth to the action which followed; I forged
the extraordinary will which gave the succession to me, but only
with the hand of Agatha; and it appeared the more natural, as,
during the period of her wedlock, she had borne no child to her
husband.&nbsp; That night and succeeding day was thus intently
occupied.&nbsp; On the following morning the corpse was
discovered by you.&nbsp; I had not seen Agatha, but, on hearing
of her meeting the body, hastened to calm her mind, <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>and prepare
her for the will, which was opened after the interment.&nbsp; I
made use of the pretext of another love, to appear repugnant to
the wishes of my brother, and quitted the castle to appease the
inquietudes of Agatha, who entreated me not to see her again
until I could make her my wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember the reading of that will; you remember the
arrival of De Broke; poor wretch! his drunken falsehoods, his
silly boasts, and above all, his ungoverned insolence, has cost
him fatally dear.&nbsp; I was not concerned at the suspicion
which fell upon him; on the contrary, I rejoiced it had found
such an object: but I trembled with horror when I beheld him
conducted to a dungeon, and reflected on the probability of his
paying the penalty of my crime.&nbsp; Guilty enough already, this
accumulation of sin appalled me, and I determined that innocent
blood at least should not cry out from earth against me.&nbsp; In
the night previous to the day fixed for his trial, which I
dreaded equally, whether he should be condemned or acquitted, I
sought his prison, and, by an exaggerated account of the popular
rage against him, prevailed upon him to accept the means of
escape; his servant who attended him, terrified by the picture I
drew of his master&rsquo;s danger, united his entreaties to <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>mine.&nbsp;
Hugh&rsquo;s courage and fortitude gave way to our solicitations;
he fled, and preserved his life at the expense of his honour and
his peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot express to you how deep was the pang the ruin
of this man&rsquo;s character gave me, nor how I shrunk from the
eyes lifted to mine in commiseration, whenever his name was
mentioned before me; even now, now that I have rendered back such
severe justice, my heart sickens as I recall the curses which I
heard heaped upon his head as the murderer of John de la
Pole.&nbsp; I should have suffered less had they branded the
criminal unknown, but to hear an innocent man thus accused for
me&mdash;O Courtenay! thou knowest not, mayest thou never know,
remorse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reasoned much even then upon the folly of this
conduct; I said, I am a cowardly villain, a sneaking murderer,
who fears the consequences of the crime he yet feared not to
commit.&nbsp; Why should I be careful of this man&rsquo;s life?
what is his safety to me? his death might be my security, at
least would prevent suspicion from falling elsewhere: are not his
manners brutal, his heart selfish, avaricious, and cruel? who
will miss him from the earth? and by whom will his loss be
mourned?&nbsp; But it is my crime for which he will <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>suffer, and
the curse of innocent blood will lie upon my head: neither has he
injured me, that I should doom him so hardly; I cannot even taste
the luxury of revenge.&nbsp; These thoughts disquieted me, and,
recurring more frequently than I could bear, influenced my
conduct in regard to the prisoner.&nbsp; &lsquo;The means of
escape shall be offered to him,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;if,
innocent, as he knows himself to be, he be coward enough to
accept them, he is worthy of the opprobrium which will cling to
him, and I ought not to grieve for that ruin of character which
he himself alone will effect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this wretched sophistry I endeavoured to reconcile
my conscience, and, strange to say, I succeeded; care and regret
departed from my bosom, and I looked forward to the day of my
approaching union with Agatha with an impatience which I found it
difficult to control: it came at length, and under happy
auspices, for all our friends were assembled around us, and I saw
in my beloved&rsquo;s tranquil smile the scarce concealed joy of
her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that day, Courtenay&mdash;you remember the
brilliant assemblage and the gay festival of night&mdash;you
remember how brightly sparkled the jest, how sweetly sounded the
song, <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>and how every creature present seemed wrapped in the
delicious intoxication of the hour&mdash;you remember my parting
commands after Agatha had retired, to carouse till the day-break,
and make the young sun a witness of your felicity; you did so; it
was a scene of joy and splendour.&nbsp; Alas! there was another,
and a widely different, passing in a more retired part of the
castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must pause in my narrative here for a few moments;
all that has as yet been detailed has been plain and simple fact,
subject to no doubts, liable to no misconstructions; hitherto all
has been clear; that which will follow is wild, strange, and
improbable&mdash;mysterious, incomprehensible indeed, yet not
less true than that which I have hitherto written.&nbsp; How
shall I make you understand what I have to present to your
mind?&nbsp; In what words shall I clothe a narrative so
extraordinary as to prevent its stamping me with the opprobrium
of folly or madness?&nbsp; Even now, in my dying hour, on the
very steps of the scaffold, I hesitate at the thought of being
lightly esteemed by thee, or my sacrifice regarded as the result
of a weakened intellect or a disordered brain: it is more easy to
die as a knave than be lamented as a fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agatha had withdrawn from the hall with <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>her
damsels, and I hastened to follow her; she had retired to an
apartment adjoining her bridal chamber, and thither, wearied of
the noise and mirth of the rioters below, I also hastened.&nbsp;
I longed for a delight I had not lately experienced, an
unreserved conversation with my wife, and to be allowed to
dismiss the coldness which, during the day, I had been obliged to
feign towards her.&nbsp; The damsels retired, and we were left to
pour out our hearts to each other in the unbounded confidence of
our new relations, when we were startled by hearing a slow and
heavy foot steadily ascending the stairs; as these were private,
leading only to our apartments, Agatha was surprised and
offended.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who would intrude at this hour?&rsquo; she
demanded, while her eyes turned anxiously towards the door.&nbsp;
For me, a thrill of horror shot through my inmost heart; I said,
relinquishing the hand I had till then so fondly clasped in mine,
&lsquo;<i>That is the step of my brother</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was so, Courtenay: a moment more and the door
slowly opened of itself to give entrance to its master; John de
la Pole entered the room and stood between Agatha and me; his
face was as in his dying hour, ghastly and menacing, and every
gash of the murderous knife upon his body as frightfully distinct
as on the <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>night they were inflicted.&nbsp; In one hand he held a
lock of dark hair; the other was extended threateningly towards
me; and thus he stood between us, drawn from another world by the
crime I meditated against his bed, and an everlasting barrier
before it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first emotion was astonishment&mdash;a boundless and
stupified surprise&mdash;then a vague and horrid notion that my
brother was not really dead, that he had escaped alive from my
hands, and was now come to accuse and surrender me up to
scorn.&nbsp; The interval which had passed since his death was
obliterated from my mind, and I felt as if that night had been
the season of the deed.&nbsp; I spoke in extenuation of my crime,
accused his selfishness, cursed his calculating cruelty; I
implored his mercy, folded my hands in supplication, and knelt
before him in humble debasement.&nbsp; No muscle of his
countenance moved, and not a sound escaped through his bruised
and blackened lips; he did not even look upon me, but continued
to fasten his stony eyes upon the face of Agatha, who stood
silent and motionless as himself, gazing like a fascinated thing
upon his aspect of horror.&nbsp; I arose from my knees&mdash;shut
my eyes&mdash;tossed my arms abroad to the air&mdash;endeavoured
to think I was in sleep, in <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>drunkenness, in delirium: no, <i>he
was still there</i>!&mdash;I thought of the agony of tempestuous
feeling I had endured on the night following the commission of
the crime, and, believing that my jaded mind was suffering under
the same infliction, resolved to seek my couch, to restore my
exhausted spirits by rest and sleep.&nbsp; I made an effort to
move from my place; I knew that motion might recall my scattered
senses; and I exerted myself to enter the chamber of
Agatha.&nbsp; Wilt thou believe me, Courtenay? the stern shadow
anticipated my movement, and, menacing me back, strode silently
towards my bridal chamber.&nbsp; At the door its menacing
attitude towards me was changed for one of command to Agatha; one
bloody finger was raised to beckon her to follow: she did
so.&nbsp; Still stupidly insensible, gazing fixedly upon his
form, she followed the direction of his hand, and passed after
him into the chamber: the door closed upon them without a
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I began to think more calmly: the dead, cold thing
was gone, and there was life and air in the apartment; the
feelings of this world came upon me, and I became sensible of
fear.&nbsp; I was safe; but where was Agatha?&mdash;<i>he</i> had
beckoned her forth&mdash;was it reality?&mdash;she was
gone&mdash;had it been the work of imagination, she had <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>still been
there&mdash;but she might have retired to her chamber
alone.&nbsp; This was to be ascertained.&nbsp; I attempted to
enter&mdash;the door was fast; I called upon Agatha&mdash;there
was no sound in reply; I reviewed the last scene, considered the
incidents of the past, weighed the appearances of the present,
and came at length to the terrible conclusion that a spirit of
the damned had stood before me, and that Agatha was still in his
grasp!&nbsp; You will not wonder that temporary insanity followed
this hideous idea: I grew wild at the thoughts of her danger; I
shrieked aloud for mercy; I tore my hair in agony, and beat at
the closed door with the utmost exertion of strength.&nbsp; I
wonder even now that none heard the uproar I made; but my cries
remained unanswered&mdash;no sound issued from the bridal chamber
of the dead, and I continued to rave until nature, exhausted,
sunk speechless and senseless to the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning had broken over the apartment when I awoke, and
I was some moments in recovering recollection of my state and
circumstances; slowly the truth came before me.&nbsp; I was lying
extended on the bare ground, the lights had burned out, and there
was no trace of visitors having been near me in my sleep.&nbsp; I
arose and <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>listened for some sound that might direct my first
movements, for now I knew not what to think nor to do.&nbsp; A
low sobbing from the chamber of Agatha riveted my attention; I
sprung towards the door, and, to my astonishment, it yielded to
the slightest touch: I entered; Agatha was there, seated upon the
bed, and gazing around her with a look of agonising affright; she
saw me on the instant, and rushed into my arms.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou
art here! thou art safe!&rsquo; she cried in delirious transport;
&lsquo;and for this I am at least grateful; I deemed he had
destroyed thee.&nbsp; But thou didst leave me, Eustace.&nbsp; O
quit me not, I beseech thee! save me from him, Eustace, for thou
alone canst!&rsquo;&nbsp; I endeavoured to soothe her anguish,
and, after some time, succeeded in restoring her to tranquillity
and composure enough to be made acquainted with the real state of
our circumstances; and I implored her to inform me whither the
ghastly phantom had led her, on their retiring from the
chamber.&nbsp; She shuddered at the question, and a wild and
strange expression passed over her countenance ere she
spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will tell thee,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;yet
it is but little that I have to say.&nbsp; To this room we came,
and our footsteps wandered no further.&nbsp; Without a word he
gave his commands to me, and without <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>a word I obeyed him.&nbsp; I
ascended my bridal bed, he had willed it so, and he continued to
gaze upon me till my head sunk upon the pillow; then the ghastly
thing sat down by my side, and though I closed mine eyes hard
that I might not behold him, yet I felt that the shadow of his
unearthly face was upon me.&nbsp; Once I looked up in the hope
that he was gone; beholding him I shrunk, and would have called
upon thee, but the stony eye of the spectre grew larger, and a
fiendish pang passed over the immoveable face; then I hid mine in
my mantle that I might look upon him no more: insensibility
succeeded, and I slept; in the morning I awoke, and he was
gone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was the tale of Agatha; thou wilt doubt its truth,
nor can I wonder at thy most natural incredulity: yet I would now
give my few short hours of life, precious as they may be, that
thou hadst been present and <i>seen</i> her tell this story; I
can give thee her words, her form of expression, but what
language of mine can portray her looks as she spoke, or describe
the harrowing tones of her voice as she cried to me for
protection?&nbsp; I doubted not; for these powerful witnesses
would have carried conviction to my mind, had I not already
beheld the shadowy thing she spoke of.</p>
<p><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>&ldquo;What could I offer in consolation?&nbsp; We wept
bitter tears together, and mingled our tender grief.&nbsp; If we
indulged a momentary hope that it was but an illusion of the
brain, and would return no more, we were quickly undeceived at
the approach of night.&nbsp; Again came the ghastly shadow, and
again was the spirit of Agatha chained by the sleep of death in
his presence.&nbsp; Nor were his visitations confined to the dark
and silent hour of night; when we met in the morning, to lament
our fate and weep from our stuffed bosoms the weight that pressed
upon our hearts, then, with a hideous familiarity, he would stand
between us, mocking, with his menacing grin and uplifted finger,
the agony his presence created.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Another</i> night came; we sat alone, solitary,
speechless, motionless; hour after hour passed, and we moved not,
except to cast stern regards towards the door, or listen with
repressed impatience to every sound in the castle.&nbsp; Slowly,
at last, came the step of the dead, heavily ascending the
stairs;&mdash;he entered&mdash;I rushed to meet him, and the long
pent up agony of my soul burst forth in madness
uncontrolled.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Monster!&mdash;murderer!&mdash;destroyer of thy father and
thy brother! why comest thou thus to torture and not kill? why is
thy bloody hand for ever raised, <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>and yet forbearing to fall?&nbsp; If
thine aim be vengeance,
strike&mdash;strike&mdash;strike&mdash;thou blood-bespotted
horror! and rend from hope and from life those who dared to make
thee what thou art!&mdash;Strike, thou silent, sullen thing! that
we may be as thou art, and learn to fear thee not!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I darted towards him, but was arrested by some
invisible barrier ere I had traversed half the distance between
us; I could not reach him, but sunk, as if felled by an unseen
blow, helpless and almost senseless, to the ground: <i>he</i> did
not even look upon me, but again sternly summoned Agatha from the
chamber, as nightly he had done before.&nbsp; I&mdash;but
wherefore dwell upon these agonies?&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that
these accumulated horrors at length drove me from the side of
Agatha to solitude and reflection: sorrow came upon my
soul&mdash;a sorrow less for my crime than for its fatal
consequences.&nbsp; &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;perhaps
the tormentor is himself more keenly punished by these hauntings
than either of his shrinking victims: said he not, in the hour of
death, that he too was a murderer? and did he not pray for time
in which to expiate the sin?&nbsp; Surely, surely, these
visitations must be the hell of the parricide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a feeling of remorse arose in my mind, <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>as I deemed
it possible that these unnatural hauntings might be
involuntary.&nbsp; I had stabbed at the life of my brother, and
plunged his unprepared spirit into the hell which awaited it; and
surely a more bitter one than looking again upon the secret deeds
of the survivors, could not well be imagined.&nbsp; Agatha, too,
no longer wept over her separation from me, but hourly called
upon Heaven for pity and for pardon; madness and anguish passed
away from her heart, and sorrow and repentance entered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not repent; at least I could not feel
self-condemnation to that degree which I had been early taught
was so necessary&mdash;that perfect sorrow which abhorred the
crime and the criminal, and which, they say, is alone the gift of
Heaven&mdash;<i>that</i> I did not feel: still, still did my
inmost soul worship the thought of Agatha, and abhor the
treachery of John de la Pole.&nbsp; I could not regret that I had
avenged my wrong&mdash;I could not repent that I had attempted to
make her mine; I knew that were the deed again to do&mdash;again
should I dare, and perform it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repentance then was not mine; but I despaired of peace,
and knew how to punish crime: I was not yet weary of life; and
though tears of remorse did not fill my eyes for my <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>brother&rsquo;s early doom, yet his unnatural tortures
now, and Agatha&rsquo;s suffering, seemed to call for something
like justice from my hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps, in the stern
mood in which I am,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;the sacrifice will be
greater than if repentance struck; and, believing myself sure of
forgiveness, I hastened to make my peace with Heaven.&nbsp; Yes;
I will die&mdash;I will inflict death upon myself as I would upon
another, and expiate crime with blood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I hesitated still; death, contemplated so near, in
any shape, was horrible; but, dealt by the hand of the
executioner&mdash;I shrunk from the thought, and could not bear
the shadow of a stain upon the honour of my house; so I went on
from day to day, dreaming of justice but rendering none, till the
birth of Agatha&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Thou wast surprised, I
believe, at the little emotion I betrayed at its sight: alas! I
had long been prepared for some object of horror, and now it was
before me.&nbsp; Thou didst behold the action of the ghastly
child; thou sawest the menacing finger upraised towards my head,
and the calm determination with which I met this image: its
presence had banished my indecision.&nbsp; I believed now that
Agatha was lost to me for ever,&mdash;that Eternal Justice by
this sign spoke against me, <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>and, in punishment of my hardness of
heart, had thus perpetuated the remembrance of my crime.&nbsp;
Now, then, I <i>resolved</i> to die: I communicated my purpose to
Agatha, and earthly feelings once more gained the mastery over my
subdued spirit, and burst forth in words of grief and reproach,
on observing that she evinced no horror at my approaching fate,
and scarcely attempted to dissuade me from my purpose!&nbsp;
Agatha, for whom I had dared and suffered so much&mdash;even she
had become indifferent to my destiny: it was indeed time to
die!&nbsp; But I did her wrong; sorrow had broken her heart, and
repeated scenes of horror had subdued and weakened her
spirit.&nbsp; With the feeling common to her sex, she sought
consolation only in religion, and thought that to reconcile
herself with Heaven was all that was left her now: love had fled
with every other human passion, and far from regarding death as
an evil, she looked upon it as a passport to bliss, and was more
ready to rejoice at than deprecate my fate.&nbsp; Her conduct
assisted my resolution.&nbsp; Now, then, the first step was to be
made&mdash;the most difficult and appalling&mdash;the rest would
be consequential and easy.&nbsp; It was necessary to begin, and I
knew of no better mode than that of rendering justice to the
living.&nbsp; Hugh de Broke had been ruined by me, <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>and it was
now incumbent upon me to restore him to honour and to happiness:
I set out for the distant and humble dwelling in which, since his
escape, he had been obliged to conceal his name and dignity: he
was stretched upon a sick-bed&mdash;a heart-broken and a dying
man: it was no physical disease of which he was
expiring,&mdash;but disgrace had poisoned the fountain of his
blood, and shame had eaten its way like a canker-worm to his
heart.&nbsp; When he saw me, he shook off his dying listlessness,
and sprung upright in his bed.&nbsp; &lsquo;What more wouldst
thou have, thou blaster of mine honour!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;of
a ruined and dying man?&nbsp; To thy pernicious counsel I owe the
shame no after-conduct can efface: cursed, cursed coward that I
was! why did I heed or believe thy murderous mercy?&nbsp; Begone,
wretch! and let me die.&nbsp; I cannot shake off this load of
shame; but I shall sink under its burthen, and bequeath its
remorse to thee; go, wretch! and let me die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was submissively attended by his wife and son, who
were earnest with me to relieve him of my presence.&nbsp; Sorrow,
and the near approach of death, had softened his heart and
chastised the natural brutality of his manners; he looked and
spoke more mildly to them, though, with all his <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>failing
strength, he continued to heap maledictions upon me.&nbsp; My
humiliations were now to begin; I kneeled down by his side,
detailed my crime without any palliation, asked his forgiveness
for the injury I had done him, and finished by avowing my
resolution to deliver myself into the hands of justice, and
restore his fame and happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was astonished, that during this confession no word
had been uttered by him whom it so deeply concerned.&nbsp; I
looked up to behold its effect; he was staring wildly at me, the
strong energies of his spirit struggling with the grasp of death
to gain time to hear its termination; he strove hard to
articulate something; and finally, whether he conquered for some
few moments the mighty power that was wrestling with him, or that
that power had now incorporated itself with his victim, and given
him of its potency, I knew not, but he suddenly grew calm and
passionless, pain and convulsion left him, his features assumed a
pale rigidity, and his voice the solemn earnestness of the grave,
as he spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have no time for question,&rsquo; he
said; &lsquo;but I pray that the truth may be upon thy lips:
soon, very soon, shall we meet again; and my pardon shall be
truly thine when thou shalt tell me that my boy sits with honour
<a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>in the
halls of his fathers.&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused, placed the hand of
his son in mine, and expired without a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What followed, I need not tell thee; the son of Hugh
was restored, and Eustace consigned to a dungeon.&nbsp; The
attempts of the people to force from me my secret, you know how I
resisted; calmly and even proudly I went to my prison and
prepared myself to die.&nbsp; I had humbled myself to De Broke,
for to him I had done deep and particular injury; but to these
men I owed no other reparation than what my life would pay: what
right had they then to demand further humiliation of me, or
attempt to rend from my bosom the mystery of its secret
purpose?&nbsp; I would die unaccusing, save myself; I would die,
shrouded in gloomy dignity,&mdash;a man to be wondered at and
feared, rather than pitied and scorned.&nbsp; I will willingly
furnish their greedy eyes with the awful feast of death, but not
their vulgar souls with the struggles and humiliations of mine;
my body is the law&rsquo;s&mdash;is theirs; my spirit is beyond
their judgment.&nbsp; John de la Pole shall sleep on, embalmed in
good opinions; I will not raise up his pall to shew them what
corruption festers beneath it; I would not tell them what he
<i>was</i>, though it should even lessen in <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>their
thought the horror of what I <i>am</i>.&nbsp; Grand and silent
death&mdash;majestic in thy obscurity&mdash;I wait to bid thee
welcome!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus far had I written, and thought that my story in
the book of life had come to its close, but other events have
crowded upon me; and before my death, (which will be on the
morrow,) I would tell thee the incidents of the last few
days.&nbsp; Thou knowest how calmly I beheld thee depart from my
prison, and how little emotion I manifested at my fate; but when
thou wert gone, when I was alone, in chains, degraded, the
enthusiasm of the moment past, and my spirit inactive, I wept
bitter tears at the waywardness of my early fate; yet I relaxed
not in my determination; I came hither to die, and nothing was
left me but to finish my purpose nobly.&nbsp; It is my will to
doom a murderer, and I am he so doomed.&nbsp; I wept, yet
persisted; cursed the cruelty which had destroyed me, and yet
prayed to my brother for pardon.&nbsp; Of the future I had as yet
scarcely thought; hitherto I had been solely employed about the
method of quitting this world, without much considering the terms
of my admission to another; now I pondered long, with anxiety,
but not with fear.&nbsp; Creeds puzzled me&mdash;I made not my
own heart&mdash;I cannot be answerable for its <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>opinions.&nbsp; I have committed a deadly sin&mdash;I
am about to expiate it with my blood&mdash;I cannot do more; and
is not this sacrifice greater than the cant of sorrow and the
whinings of prayer from one who never prayed before?&nbsp; The
one is from myself, the child of my resolution&mdash;the other
the offspring of fear&mdash;But I was distracted still, and
bewildered.&nbsp; It was in this disturbed state that I was
startled by a light sound in my prison&mdash;I listened&mdash;a
soft voice, for the second time, pronounced in kindly accents,
&lsquo;My brother!&rsquo;&nbsp; I started up and gazed around me;
on the opposite side of my dungeon stood the form of John de la
Pole, but not as I had seen him last, pale, menacing, and bloody,
but with that mild aspect and gentle look that had distinguished
his early brotherhood, ere Agatha&rsquo;s fatal beauty cut
asunder the knot that bound our souls together.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou
hast done well,&rsquo; said the gentle spirit, &lsquo;thus to
render up thy life for thy crime; thy severe justice hath merited
and obtained thy pardon; my sufferings, too, the punishment for
unrepented sin, thy firmness hath terminated; and the days of
Agatha shall henceforth flow more peaceful.&nbsp; Soon shalt thou
be with me, O brother! and the kiss of immortality shall be given
to thee by my lips: weep not&mdash;doubt not&mdash;but bear all
things steadfastly; <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>in thine hour of agony I will stand
by thy side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tender grief overpowered my spirit as he spoke, and
tears fell from my eyes.&nbsp; I extended my arms as if I would
have embraced him, but the barrier between the living and the
dead could not as yet be passed, and the shadow receded from my
touch.&nbsp; But this visitation had brought joy to my heart and
tranquillity to my spirit, and the arrival of Agatha at the
prison still further reconciled me to my doom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thy
sacrifice is hallowed,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;thou wilt die, but
I must live to expiate my crime, as the slave of thy ghastly son,
till Heaven shall call him to itself.&nbsp; <i>He</i> stood by my
couch last night; smilingly he looked upon me, as in the days of
his early love, and bade me live and hope: in this world I shall
behold him no more! but thou, my beloved! thou art for the
distant land, and the abode whither he is gone before thee.&nbsp;
Oh that I might share thy doom, as I have already partaken thy
guilt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We parted&mdash;let me not dwell upon that&mdash;we
parted for ever; for me there remained a mighty duty to fulfil,
and from which I did not shrink&mdash;no, not even when those who
had been my friends sought to wring my secret from my <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>heart by
the infliction of the torture: I pitied <i>them</i>, but not
myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day of torture came; thou wert by my side, and
didst urge a voluntary death to rescue me from agony and the
stare of burning eyes eagerly watching my pangs.&nbsp; I rejected
thy counsel; yet didst thou not forsake me, but marched to the
scene of my infamy by my side.&nbsp; All around, as I went
thither, did I look for the promised appearance of my brother,
and trembled lest I should not behold him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely
this is mine hour of agony,&rsquo; I said, as I ascended the
steps of the scaffold; &lsquo;wherefore is he not by my
side?&rsquo;&nbsp; And the guest from the other world,&mdash;he
beneath whose scowl my heart had for months been
withering,&mdash;was desired with more impatience than ever I had
felt for the presence of earthly friends.&nbsp; I had not long to
fear or to doubt&mdash;he was there before me; on reaching the
scaffold, I beheld him standing by the block, and calmly and
silently smiling a welcome to his brother.&nbsp; Thou didst
behold my firmness, and the multitude saw my composure with
wonder; but they beheld not the cause; they saw not that
<i>he</i> was looking on, and that I drew in resolution from his
smile, and firmness from his awful brow.</p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>&ldquo;The ineffectual agony was past&mdash;curiosity
was silenced&mdash;and I was condemned to die; and to-morrow I
<i>shall</i> die,&mdash;from all that I have loved, hated, or
valued, I shall be torn to-morrow.&nbsp; The last sunset is
falling upon my paper, is gilding my pen as I write; to-morrow it
will sparkle upon the edge of the axe, and illuminate a brow from
which the inward light will have departed for ever; to-morrow
will be the scene of my last humiliation; but <i>he</i> will be
there to witness it; and convert it by his presence into a
triumph: and, when all shall be over, when the last mortal throb
shall be past, what then shall be my destiny?&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou
art pardoned,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and an immortality is before
thee!&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh, then, let me hope for an immortality of
peace!&nbsp; Now, then, I will go sleep&mdash;exhausted nature
must be recruited for her great labour to-morrow&mdash;for these
broken limbs, these strained sinews, and this bruised flesh, must
needs want repose, ere they can encounter the task of fresh
exertion.&nbsp; Serve me well, ye mangled limbs, but to-morrow,
and I shall require your service no more.&mdash;Courtenay, good
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the tale of the fratricide, and of him who was his
victim: of her who survived the deaths of both, no more was
heard; for upon Courtenay&rsquo;s going to the cottage at the
period <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>she had appointed to receive her last commands, he
learned she had quitted it two days previous, but had left a
small parcel to be given to him; it contained a few remembrances
of herself and Eustace, and the following letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Courtenay</span>&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In giving thee the papers containing our story, I have
obeyed the last wish of him whose lightest word was a law to me;
but I cannot look on thee again after this communication.&nbsp;
Grieve not for me, for my lot will not be wretched; the death of
my child has released me from the world, and I hasten to withdraw
myself from it: I had arranged all things for the purpose before
I sent to request thy presence.&nbsp; Endeavour not to discover
me; such search would be fruitless and vain.&nbsp; I retire from
the kingdom; and in a convent of Clairs, beneath the habits and
rules of the order, and under another name, conceal for ever,
from the eyes of the world, the person, the crime, and the sorrow
of</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Somewhere</span> about the year 112, in
winter or summer&mdash;we are not exactly prepared to say
which&mdash;died Olave the Second, one of the early kings of
Denmark; he was a &ldquo;fellow of no reckoning,&rdquo; for he
took no account of any thing that occurred during his reign,
except the making of strong drink, and the number of butts in his
cellar.&nbsp; His <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>majesty, it must be avowed, was in the presumptuous
habit of forestalling the joys of heaven, (we mean Odin&rsquo;s,)
that is to say, he impiously got drunk every day of his life,
before the regular allowance of fighting, the customary number of
enemies&rsquo; broken heads, and his own orderly death upon the
field of battle, bore testimony that he was properly qualified
for such supreme enjoyment.&nbsp; Olave in his life was a happy
fellow; for, never having been sober during one hour of it, he
had not the misfortune to hear all the ill-natured things that
his courtiers and subjects said of his enormities, behind his
back, or when he was asleep.&nbsp; It must, however, be
acknowledged that, even among the unscrupulous Danes, who were
not at that period remarkable for their practice of sobriety,
Olave was a filthy fellow: to this hour he is held up as a
monument of brutality and stupidity, and the memory of Jeroboam,
the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, was not more devoted to
execration among the Jews, than that of king Olave the Second
among the Danes.&nbsp; On his death-bed, however, when he could
no longer swallow his usual enlivening potations, blue devils
beset his nights, and conscience twitted him with his ill-spent
days.&nbsp; He had never broken a head in his life, except by
proxy; and how could he make <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>his appearance in Valhalla without a
skull to drink out of?&mdash;to knock at the gates of Valasciolf
without a goblet in his hand?&mdash;The thing was impossible; it
was clear he would be kicked through Asgard, and sent to fret in
Nifthiem, where the burning claws of Lok would set fire to the
good liquor incorporated with his being, and reduce him to the
condition of an eternal, thinking cinder!&mdash;Miserable
anticipations! he tried to weep; but water, which he had hitherto
scorned, now scorned him, and absolutely refused to come at his
desire: he shed tears of mead, which he caught in his mouth as
fast as they fell, partly from fear lest Odin should remark them,
and partly because he could not endure to see good liquor
wasted.</p>
<p>But all things have an end&mdash;in this world at
least&mdash;and so it was with the life and repentance of king
Olave the Second; he died without the drinking-cup he had
regretted so deeply, and before he had time to frame a decent
apology to Odin for venturing into Valhalla without one.&nbsp;
There was a world of business now to be done at the palace of
Sandaal: a dead king to be buried, and two living kings to be
crowned; for such was the will of the lamented Olave, that both
his sons should succeed him.&nbsp; They were princes of very <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>different
characters, yet their father, it should seem, loved them equally,
as he divided his dominions very fairly between them, to the no
small disgust of the elder prince, Frotho, who, like the imperial
Octavius, some years before, could not bear a divided
throne.&nbsp; This worthy in character resembled, in no slight
degree, his excellent father, of dozy memory, for he loved to
drink much and fight little,&mdash;more especially as his younger
brother Harold had a decided vocation for the latter employment,
and none at all for the former: to him, therefore, he left the
charge of the glory of the Danish crown, while he, for the
present, contented himself with drinking to his successes.&nbsp;
This good understanding, however, between the princes could not
last for ever.&nbsp; Frotho was, after all, only half a drunkard,
and therefore extremely sulky in his cups&mdash;more especially
when his queen Helga seated herself at his elbow to twit his
courage with the heroic deeds of his brother.&nbsp; Queen
consorts should not meddle with politics, they never do any thing
but mischief&mdash;and so it proved in this instance; for Frotho
grew absolutely delirious, kept himself entirely sober for three
whole days, buckled on his wooden target, put himself at the head
of his troops, and, swearing to be revenged upon his <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>brother,
marched on an expedition to Jutland.&nbsp; The expedition neither
answered his intentions nor expectations; the men of Jutland were
too many for king Frotho, for, headed by Feggo, (the murderous
uncle of the philosophic Hamlet, whose father was prince only of
this part of Denmark,) they drove Frotho &ldquo;home without
boots, and in foul weather too,&rdquo; as Glendwr did, long
afterwards, king Harry Bolingbroke.&nbsp; Frotho could not
stomach this affront&mdash;the beating was hard of digestion: his
subjects made mouths at him too, and mimicked a race whenever he
appeared in public.&nbsp; So he sent his brother, king Harold,
who was a fighter to the back-bone, to chastise the Jutlanders,
which when he had done most effectually, Frotho grew more angry
still; he detested his brother, dreaded his popularity, feared
his wisdom, and quivered at his anger,&mdash;so he began to
consider seriously how he might cleverly and quietly put him out
of the way.</p>
<p>King Frotho had two counsellors, neither of whom ever agreed
with the other in the advice they gave his majesty: the reason
was tolerably obvious, for the one was an honest man, the other a
rogue, and, like the Topaz and Ebene of Voltaire, they bewildered
the unhappy monarch with the diversity of their opinions and
advice.&nbsp; On <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>this occasion, however, king Frotho troubled only the
rogue for his, which he was pretty certain beforehand would not
differ very widely from his own.&nbsp; Eric Swen was an
unprincipled ragamuffin, who hated Harold, because he had
discovered that Harold hated his vices; and, as that prince had
two sons who were rising into manhood, he shuddered at the
prospect of two or three strict warrior reigns, which would
certainly bring virtue into fashion: the prince had refused him,
too, the hand of his sister, which, to make the refusal more
bitter, he had bestowed upon his rival in the council and camp,
Frotho&rsquo;s general, Haquin.&nbsp; All these offences were
carefully summoned up, to inflame his ire against Harold, by the
devil, in the shape of Frotho, who promised him&mdash;Heaven
knows what&mdash;both on earth and in Valhalla, if he would only
push king Harold from his share of the stool, and leave both
halves of it to Frotho.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all the provocations on both sides, the
confederates were two or three whole years before they could
&ldquo;screw their courage to the sticking place,&rdquo; that is,
to the pitch necessary for the murder of king Harold.&nbsp; They
had sent fifty inconsiderable nobles, whom they had found
troublesome, to Asgard, without ceremony; but Harold was a king
and a warrior, and required a <a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>good deal.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we could
but pour poison into his ear,&rdquo; said Eric; &ldquo;Or into
his cup,&rdquo; replied Frotho; &ldquo;Or stab him in his
sleep,&rdquo; said Eric; &ldquo;Or coax him out hunting with
us,&rdquo; replied the brother, &ldquo;and give it to him quietly
in the forest.&rdquo;&nbsp; But none of these safe plans would
answer;&mdash;so Frotho, accompanied by his sole and trusty
counsellor, rode off for the forest, to find the cave where,
tradition said, had resided, from the days of the
&ldquo;Avater&rdquo; of Odin, his enemy Biorno, the descendant of
Lok, grand nephew of Surter, and first cousin to the Wolf Fenris
and Serpent Midgard.&nbsp; Frotho, however well disposed to beg
the aid and advice of the sorcerer, by no means felt quite at
ease when he considered the family to which he belonged: the wolf
and the eternal earth-circling snake were known to bear no very
great partiality to the race of Odin,&mdash;and Frotho, they
knew, if they knew any thing, was a true son of their
enemy.&nbsp; Still the Danish monarch trotted on with his squire
till they reached the centre of the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, Eric,&rdquo; said his majesty, as they
trotted on cosily together; &ldquo;after all&rdquo;&mdash;but, as
an historian, I must make one observation here: you are aware,
dear reader, that the Scandinavians of the year 112, and some
time <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>after, did not use the same simple, plain, common-place
sort of style which they have adopted to express their meaning
now-a-days.&nbsp; If we may believe their own writers, they were
always in alt, gave their commands in a kind of heroic prose, and
carried on dialogues in a sort of rambling blank verse.&nbsp; It
must therefore be obvious to you, dear reader, that I spare you
their language, and only give you their sentiments, which, to the
best of my humble ability, I will translate for you into decent
colloquial English, the better to carry your patience through the
long-winded history which I am preparing as a trial for it.&nbsp;
But to return to Frotho the Fifth of Denmark.&nbsp; &ldquo;After
all, Eric,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have perhaps no great reason
to fear these ugly immortals: as I am going to consult their
kinsman, and am withal very well disposed to put an end to the
race of Odin, (that part of it at least most devoted to him,) I
think they may be civil to me.&nbsp; My own son Sevald is the
only member of the family I wish to preserve, and I may soon
mould him to my own opinions.&nbsp; If the sorcerer will only
dispose of Harold for me, or tell me how I may safely dispose of
him, I shall not haggle on the terms of assistance; I will do any
thing to serve him or his, which may not interfere with my own
safety, or rob me of the diadem I <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>am so anxious to wear
alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eric was about to reply to his magnanimous
master, but paused, half afraid, as he discovered they were
really in the sorcerer&rsquo;s neighbourhood, for the yawning
mouth of the cave was actually staring them in the face.&nbsp;
Frotho, as became him, now took the lead, and marched dauntlessly
forward, though not without a glance backward now and then to see
if Eric was close behind him, and as any sound struck upon his
ear that bore any resemblance to a hiss or a howl.&nbsp; At
length, after many turnings and windings, he found himself in a
cavern of large dimensions, broadly lighted by a huge iron lamp,
suspended from the upper part of it.&nbsp; He turned round to
make some remark to his patient tail-piece, but was petrified to
observe that he had fallen to the earth stiff and insensible to
every thing around him.&nbsp; The Danish monarch&rsquo;s cheeks
waxed pale, and his knees began to smite each other; nevertheless
he grasped the hilt of his falchion, as a slight noise on the
opposite side withdrew his attention from the insensible Eric
Swen; there stood an old man of reverend aspect, mildly but
steadily gazing upon the king: &ldquo;Art thou he whom I have
been so long taught to expect?&rdquo; said the sorcerer;
&ldquo;art thou the king of the race of Odin, alone chosen by his
invincible <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>foe to render a service to the son of Lok, and deserve
the everlasting gratitude of his children? <a
name="citation242"></a><a href="#footnote242"
class="citation">[242]</a>&nbsp; If indeed thou art the
appointed, I bid thee highest welcome, for the task decreed to
thee hath been denied to the immortals, above whom the grateful
Lok will raise thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frotho recovered his spirits at this address; half his
business was already done, for his wishes were anticipated.&nbsp;
He had been so little accustomed to receive compliments from his
subjects, that his opinion of his own endowments had not been
particularly high; but now he began to think he had mistaken
himself, and was really a much greater man than he had
suspected.&nbsp; He readily promised obedience to the sorcerer,
upon certain terms, and assured him of his assistance when and
wherever it might be demanded.&nbsp; The magician then proceeded
to inform him that he was himself a descendant of Lok, and an
ally of the spirits of fire, those daring beings who had for so
many thousand years waged war with various success against Odin
and his warriors, and which warfare would not cease till the end
of the world; when, during a night which was to last a year,
there would be a general battle, in which Earth, Niftheim, and
Asgard, would go to wreck, and the conquering party be elevated
to a <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>newer and more beautiful heaven in Gimle,&mdash;while
Nastrande, a still gloomier hell, would be made out of the
fragments of the old one, for the accommodation of the party
conquered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Balder!&rdquo; exclaimed Frotho, starting
at this part of the story,&mdash;for he never liked to hear any
thing of the old hell, which he thought quite bad enough without
the spirits troubling themselves about the creation of another;
&ldquo;but I thought, sir sorcerer, that the wicked alone would
be punished in Nastrande, after the long night and battle of the
gods; I thought&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Exactly so, my son,&rdquo;
interrupted the sorcerer; &ldquo;the wicked certainly; for the
conquered <i>will</i> be the wicked&mdash;that is beyond dispute;
but <i>who</i> will conquer is not so certain; perhaps Lok,
perhaps Odin&mdash;each, as far as I see, have an equal chance;
take part then with us, and share our danger and glories in the
next world, and our certain assistance in this.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
this world, then, (as king Frotho had at present more business in
it,) he limited his wishes, and gave Biorno his steady attention
as he proceeded in his narrative, &ldquo;Odin,&rdquo; the
magician continued to observe, &ldquo;though utterly unable to
chain entirely the powers of Lok, had just now decidedly the
advantage; for he had a few hundred years before seized upon his
eldest son, <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>the unwary Surter, whom he had caught out of his own
territories, and wedged him, in the shape of a raven, into an
iron cage, there to remain till one of his own race, a kingly son
of his blood, should release him:&rdquo;&mdash;a condition from
Odin probably implying an eternal punishment,&mdash;as that
divinity, who does not appear to have been as omniscient as he
ought, never imagined any member of his house would have been
found silly enough to fulfil it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo;
continued the magician, &ldquo;I have consulted the eternal
powers, and find that thou, Frotho of Denmark, art the king
destined to this wondrous deed, and its following union with the
immortals.&rdquo;&nbsp; Frotho gave his assent to all and any
thing proposed; and the sorcerer immediately began his
operations; he raised his ebon wand above his head, with many
magical flourishes&mdash;turned himself rapidly round&mdash;then
more slowly, pausing at each of the cardinal points, and calling
north, south, east, and west, upon the tremendous name of
Lok.&nbsp; At that sound, so terrible even to the ears of
spirits, the thunder began to rumble and the fires of Niftheim
flash through the gloomy cavern; something like music was heard,
and, though the concert was hardly better than those performed by
king Frotho&rsquo;s own band during his drinking <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>orgies, yet
as the voices (and they were many) solely employed their powers
in singing his praises, and the approaching deliverance of the
god by his means, his majesty was pleased to think nothing in
heaven could be half so fine.&nbsp; Presently the earth shook,
and the sides of the cavern rocked; Biorno pointed to the bottom
of the cave,&mdash;and Frotho beheld it, after a few violent
convulsions, suddenly open, and disclose to his view an enormous
raven, in a gigantic iron cage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said
the magician to him, &ldquo;the prison of the immortal prince of
fire!&mdash;in that shape he must remain a hundred thousand
years, unless a kingly hand of the line of Odin shall restore him
(by breaking the bars of his iron cage) to power and to
liberty.&nbsp; Monarch of Denmark! go,&mdash;and success attend
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Frotho obeyed immediately; he made a desperate
attack upon the iron cage, but failed in his intention of rending
away its bars; he made many earnest efforts, but all in
vain,&mdash;the bars remained unbroken.&nbsp; The Dane paused in
vexation&mdash;he was frightened and mortified&mdash;and, by the
howls and groans which resounded on all sides of the cavern, it
was evident the anxious spirits of Niftheim sympathised in his
distress: Biorno too, afflicted beyond measure at the ill success
of the enterprise, threw <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>himself upon the earth, tore off his
magical cap, plucked up his hair by the roots, and howled as
loudly as the noisiest of them.&nbsp; This dismal sight drove
Frotho desperate; he collected all his energies for one mighty
pull, rushed upon the cage, grappled with the bars, and, in an
instant, threw them at the sorcerer&rsquo;s feet, who sprung up
like an elk to receive them.&nbsp; Frotho stood majestically
silent, while an uproar, such as no human ear has ever heard
since, began its diversions in the cavern; a thick black mist
quickly filled its whole space, so that Frotho could but
indistinctly distinguish the figures who made up the ball;
millions of shadows were flitting about, and millions of voices
were laughing, singing, shouting, groaning, and cursing.&nbsp;
Midgard raised his glittering snaky head above the darkness and
the shadows, and greeted the monarch with a cordial and
complimentary hiss; wolf Fenris tried hard for a good-natured
howl; and the grim Hela, their sister, the queen of death,
tortured her ghastly face into a smile, as she capered nimbly
backwards and forwards in the festival, animated by the thought
of the many meals Frotho would furnish for her famished
maw.&nbsp; But, at length, the immortals grew weary of their own
noises&mdash;the infernal jollification <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>came to an
end&mdash;the mist cleared off&mdash;the fires went out&mdash;the
uproar died away,&mdash;and Frotho&rsquo;s courage returned to
its half-bewildered master, who took heart once again to look
about him.&nbsp; He was alone (to his great joy) with Biorno,
except that, in place of the raven and his cage, there sat,
reposing upon a light cloud, his beautiful brow diademed with his
native element, the triumphant prince of fire, in all the pride
of beauty and victory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Frotho, son of Olave,&rdquo;
said the sweet voice of the spirit; &ldquo;bravest among the
brave, and wisest of the sons of Odin,&mdash;what is thy will
with me?&nbsp; Tax my gratitude, preserver; ask, and obtain thy
wishes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Frotho waited for no further encouragement,
but directly stated his wishes to reign alone in Denmark, and
sweep off all the collaterals of his house, who were such bars to
his glory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy brother&rsquo;s life I give
thee,&rdquo; said the spirit; &ldquo;destroy him when thou wilt,
but be cautious to keep it secret: his elder son shall in vain
endeavour to oppose thee&mdash;I will baffle his claim, and
proclaim thee sole monarch in Denmark; but touch not the life of
Haldane; he has offended Lok, and the god demands the victim,
whom he will receive from no mortal hand: for Harold the younger,
do with him as thou wilt, but, if thou spare his life, he <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>shall have
no power to harm thee;
go&mdash;reign&mdash;prosper;&mdash;nothing shall do thee wrong
till thyself shall fulfil a decree which is gone forth respecting
thee; thou shall prosper till thy hand shall unite thy own blood
to that of thy deadliest foe: beware of this, and
triumph.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Prince of the powers of
Niftheim,&rdquo; said Frotho, &ldquo;surely Harold, my brother,
is my deadliest foe, and he has no daughter to whom I can give my
son; but I will be mindful of thy words, and remember thy
warning.&rdquo;&nbsp; The spirit then desired him, should any
event disturb his tranquillity, to come to the cavern and strike
thrice upon the side where stood the iron cage: &ldquo;Biorno
shall meet thee,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;and yield thee, in
my name, such help as thou mayest require;&rdquo; then, slowly
and silently encircling himself in the clouds which surrounded
him, he gradually disappeared from the sight of Frotho, leaving
the cavern illuminated only by the light of the iron lamp which
hung from its centre.&nbsp; Biorno, too, had vanished, leaving
him alone with Eric Swen, who, now easily awakened from his
trance, prepared to follow his master home, who simply informed
his confidant that he had consulted the magician, who had advised
the murder of Harold, and promised him success in its
performance.&nbsp; This was <a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>readily undertaken by the profligate
Eric, who, watching, with a lynx-like assiduity, his opportunity,
plunged his sword in the heart of the unhappy Harold with such
right good will and judgment, that the prince died before he knew
he was wounded: nor was Frotho behind his confederate in the good
management of a difficult affair, and skill in getting out of a
dilemma; and this was especially proved, when the body of Eric
Swen, transfixed by a well-aimed javelin, was found stark and
stiff by the side of king Harold, and Frotho ordered every body
to believe that these enemies had fallen in single combat with
each other.</p>
<p>There was one Dane in the court of king Frotho who took the
liberty of believing contrarily to the royal orders; this was the
brave Haquin, the brother-in-law of the two kings, and their
favourite general and minister: he knew Frotho, and he suspected
foul play.&nbsp; He secured the persons of his murdered
master&rsquo;s two sons, and, giving out that Haldane should
challenge his father&rsquo;s crown against Frotho, in an assembly
of the states, retired from the court to his own towers, till the
nobles should be pleased to appoint a day for hearing the claim
of his ward.&nbsp; In the mean time, Haldane himself had not been
idle; <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>he
employed a good number of his vacant hours in making tender love
to his beautiful cousin, the young Ildegarda, and laying at her
feet the crown which he <i>was</i> to have, and which Ildegarda
accepted, as a thing of course; for she already considered
herself the queen of Denmark.&nbsp; Haldane was tenderly beloved,
and they each looked forward to the day on which he was to claim
his father&rsquo;s crown from the ambitious Frotho, as that which
was to seal their love and their happiness.</p>
<p>That day at length arrived; the states, the nobles, the
warriors, and a great part of the troops, were assembled in an
open plain, where Frotho, on his throne, awaited the arrival of
his kinsman.&nbsp; His majesty had arrayed himself with peculiar
splendour for this solemn occasion; his long hair, now slightly
tinged with grey, floated down his back, while all his face was
clean shaven, except his upper lip, which exhibited a most
magnanimous mustache; his breast, arms, and legs were painted in
the brightest blue, and the most fashionable pattern in Denmark;
a short petticoat of lynx skin, fastened round his waist by the
paws of the animal, descended to his knees; and from his
shoulders to his heels, secured round his neck by claws of gold,
fell the robe of royal magnificence, the mantle made of the skins
of <a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>many
ermines; his feet were defended by shoes of the sable of the
black fox; his neck was ornamented by a chain of gold, and the
regal circle of the same precious metal shone through his locks
around his temples; on his left arm was a target of leather,
studded with brass nails of unusual brightness and immense value;
in his right hand he held the sceptre; he sat upon a throne
covered with the hides of wolves, and over his head floated, in
proud sublimity, the standard of Denmark, the raven.</p>
<p>People may talk as long as they please about innate dignity
and the majesty of mind, but the majesty of fine clothes has a
much greater influence upon popular opinion,&mdash;else wherefore
that elderly proverb which sayeth that &ldquo;fine feathers make
fine birds?&rdquo;&nbsp; Every body knows that king Herod&rsquo;s
silver petticoat made the stupid mob of Judea mistake him for a
god; and on this day, so important to Haldane, Frotho&rsquo;s
amazing magnificence made <i>his</i> people mistake him for a
hero.&nbsp; So strong ran the tide of popular opinion, that when
Haldane, simply habited, mounted on his snow-white steed, and
only attended by Haquin and a few of his father&rsquo;s friends,
rode up the area, they scarcely deigned (though he was rich in
all the pride of youth and graceful beauty) to consider <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>him worth
looking at: all eyes were turned to Frotho&rsquo;s painted
waistcoat and superb ermine cloak; and Haldane also beheld, with
extreme disgust, that all his own friends, and the warriors
favourable to his claims, who had fought by his side under his
father&rsquo;s banner, had been carefully excluded from the
council, which he beheld supplied by the creatures of his uncle;
he saw that his cause was lost before he could say a word: he was
not daunted nevertheless; he demanded his right from Frotho, who,
refusing to admit his claim, was challenged by the youth to
decide the quarrel on the spot.&nbsp; &ldquo;The states and the
troops are present,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;let them be
witnesses of this combat, which thy ungenerous ambition must
render mortal: if thou desirest a double crown, shew that thou
knowest how to defend it; descend from thy throne, meet me
fairly, and let Denmark be the reward of the
conqueror.&rdquo;&nbsp; Slowly, very slowly, king Frotho rose
from his throne, for he saw that something was expected of him:
although not precisely a coward, he had no mind to encounter his
nephew, whose feats of arms he well knew; and earnestly and
anxiously he put up a prayer to Surter to remember his promise,
and baffle his kinsman in this trying emergency.&nbsp; Surter was
not deaf; for <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>scarcely had the monarch put forth one leg for the
purpose of descending from his throne, ere a wonder attracted the
attention of the whole assembly; the sound of rushing wings was
heard from a distance, and slowly, sailing steadily through the
clear air towards his point, appeared a gigantic raven: black as
the shining locks of Odin was the magnificent and stately bird,
who, tranquilly passing over the multitude, suspended himself in
air over the head of Frotho, and, hovering steadily above him,
clapped his enormous pinions in triumph.&nbsp; Haldane suspected
a trick&mdash;Haquin was startled&mdash;but the multitude beheld
a miracle, and the will of Odin clearly expressed by his own
particular messenger: the bird hovered in the air a few moments,
to witness the general acknowledgment of Frotho, then, amidst the
deafening shouts of the people, ascended slowly upwards, cleaved
through the clouds, and vanished.</p>
<p>Haldane stood apart, during the scene, in proud contempt of
the ingratitude of his people; and the multitude were making too
terrific an uproar to allow his few friends one word in his
favour.&nbsp; Frotho, pleased by the timely aid of Surter, was
grateful for the first time in his life; and, remembering the
commands of the spirit, abstained from taking what he yet
scarcely knew <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>how to spare, the hated life of Haldane.&nbsp; Assuming
an air of paternal interest and kindness, he bade the young
prince retire from his presence and kingdom, without fear of
molestation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Son of my brother,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;seek another kingdom for thy rule, this the gods have
given to Frotho; retire peaceably, and take with thee what part
of my treasure thou wilt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The crown,
then,&rdquo; boldly replied the prince; &ldquo;for what is there,
traitor! in thy power to bestow, that is not already mine by
right?&nbsp; No! mean-souled coward!&nbsp; I scorn thy courtesy,
and I defy thy anger.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this gallant resistance
availed nothing in a lost cause; his own party counselled him,
for the present, to get out of the reach of Frotho&rsquo;s
javelin; and, too wise to disdain advice alike given by friends
and enemies, he obeyed their wishes, and, after taking a tender
leave of his betrothed Ildegarda, and promising to claim her as a
king, withdrew to Sweden to solicit aid from its warlike monarch
in defence of his title,&mdash;aid which he did not receive; for
king Frotho soon after received notice that he had been murdered
on that inhospitable coast soon after his landing, and, as it
could never be ascertained by whom, Frotho silently congratulated
himself upon the sure and ready vengeance of his ally and
divinity, Surter.&nbsp; Haquin, <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>alarmed by this circumstance, and
more than ever suspecting the honesty of king Frotho, withdrew
from court with the young Harold, now the sole surviving son of
his murdered master, and, proclaiming him lawful king of Denmark,
set up his standard in the heart of the country.&nbsp; Many
powerful nobles, disgusted by the cruel brutality of his uncle,
immediately joined him; and Frotho, frightened by danger into
valour, and relying upon the promises of Surter, put himself at
the head of his troops, and prepared for a civil war.</p>
<p>Many skirmishes took place between the hostile powers, though
nothing very decisive occurred; but the troops of Frotho had
generally the advantage, and always when the king commanded in
person.&nbsp; Joy of this discovery nearly upset his majesty; he
began to think himself a great general as well as a gallant
warrior: he got exceedingly drunk with some of his old cronies
who had made the discovery, and, during the deep sleep which
followed this little extravagance, Haquin attacked his camp, beat
his generals, carried off his son Sevald a prisoner, and nearly
seized upon his sacred majesty himself, who knew nothing at all
of the matter.&nbsp; Poor Sevald was marched off for the camp of
the enemy, in a transport of sorrow and despair.</p>
<p><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>&ldquo;Be not offended, prince,&rdquo; said the good
Haquin to him when he was brought before him in his
tent,&mdash;&ldquo;be not offended that the chance of war has
placed thy person in my custody for a season; it is no dishonour
to be the prisoner of Haquin.&nbsp; Our war is with thy father,
not with thee; and should Harold succeed, even to the slaying of
his uncle, he will never wrong thee, but yield thee thy just
right, a second throne in Denmark: be not disturbed therefore at
the slight accident of this war.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was kindly
meant, but it entirely failed in its purpose, and Sevald would
have still continued to grieve if he had not discovered, that
fair princesses are better comforters than old soldiers.&nbsp; He
learned that his lovely cousin Ildegarda was in the camp of her
father, and he concluded that things were not quite so bad as
they might have been.&nbsp; Sevald admired his fair kinswoman
extremely, and, as Haldane&rsquo;s death had set her free, he
worked out the prettiest little romantic scheme possible for
putting an end to the horrors of civil war and restoring peace to
Denmark: he determined to entreat his father to give him
Ildegarda for his bride, to adopt Harold as his partner, and thus
to reconcile all parties to his ascendancy; but, unhappily for
poor Sevald&rsquo;s delightful scheme, all <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>the persons
concerned in it were, though for different reasons, materially
against it.&nbsp; Ildegarda, true to the memory of Haldane, would
listen to no second love,&mdash;Haquin, faithful to the cause he
had adopted, would rather have consigned his daughter to the
grave than to the arms of a son of Frotho,&mdash;and the Danish
monarch would entirely have lost the little wit he possessed, at
the bare possibility of such a destructive union as that of his
own blood with that of his deadliest foe, for such now had the
father of Ildegarda become to him.&nbsp; When he did hear it, he
grew absolutely wild with terror and rage; he imprecated the most
deadly curses upon his son, should he venture to espouse his
cousin; and flew off like a madman to the cave of Biorno in the
forest, to consult him in this most desperate emergency.&nbsp; He
found the sorcerer at home, and willing to assist him, which he
civilly did by the best advice in his power; he desired him to
return to his camp and attack the troops of Haquin, promising to
commit that leader, his daughter, and prince Sevald, safely into
his custody; at the same time hinting that, as Surter had done as
much for his friend as could decently be expected, he need not
call upon him for further assistance, which, unless from his own
imprudence, he would not need, <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>and Lok had prohibited them from
supplying.&nbsp; Frotho thanked him for past favours and present
services, and, promising to demand nothing more for the future,
they parted good friends, though not to meet again in this world
at least, whatever might happen in the other.&nbsp; Frotho had no
sooner reached his camp, than he hastened to profit by his
friend&rsquo;s advice, and instantly experienced its salutary
effects; he defeated his antagonists in a pitched battle,
recovered his son Sevald, and, to his infinite joy, possessed
himself of the persons of Haquin and his daughter, though Harold
escaped in the battle, and hid himself securely from the pursuit
of his enemy.&nbsp; Had Frotho followed the suggestions of his
own cruel heart, he would have decided Haquin&rsquo;s destiny at
once by taking off his head; but, fearful of his nobles, who held
the chief in high esteem, and having likewise no hope of
discovering Harold, except through his friend, he resolved to
spare his existence, but to keep him in close imprisonment with
his daughter, whose influence over Sevald he still dreaded, and
whom, as the daughter of his sister, he dared not injure
farther.&nbsp; The poor prince wept bitterly over his ruined
hopes, and Frotho rejoiced at the delightful consummation of his:
he enjoyed himself <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>in his own way, killing and drinking by
turns,&mdash;till, in a fit of madness and extravagance, he
impiously declared that he had a Valhalla of his own, which he
would not change for Odin&rsquo;s, upon any terms that divinity
could offer.&nbsp; Every thing was happiness in the palace, and
Frotho was the most mischievous and merry of kings.</p>
<h3><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>PART
II.<br />
THE ISLE OF THE MAELSTROM.</h3>
<blockquote><p>What have we here? a Man or a Fish?&mdash;Legged
like a Man, and his fins like arms.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Every</span> sweet hath its
sour,&rdquo; saith a very respectable old ballad,&mdash;and truly
there is wisdom in the saying.&nbsp; King Frotho&rsquo;s
sanctity, as a crowned prince of the holy race of Odin, became at
this period, for the first time, somewhat of an inconvenience to
him.&nbsp; In the midst of his festivities, howls and cries
penetrated to his palace, and reached his ears, though surrounded
by buzzing flatterers, and rendered dizzy by strong
potations.&nbsp; His people of Norway were unhappy, and they
called upon their common father to relieve their misery.&nbsp; A
pest had arisen among them which no one could conquer, for no one
knew how to attack: the frightful whirlpool of the <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>Maelstrom
had a guest, and the desolate island of Moskoe an inhabitant; it
was neither man, beast, bird, nor fish, that had taken up his
residence in this part of his Danish majesty&rsquo;s dominions,
but a most extraordinary compound monster, possessing all the
faculties of each of these several creations.&nbsp; As he had his
little island entirely to himself, the want of society suggested
to him an expedient by way of amusement, and also of remedying
this evil&mdash;he employed his leisure in making descents upon
the Norwegian coast, and carrying off the grown inhabitants, four
or five at a time, and the little children by dozens, whom he
devoured with as little remorse as he would young rabbits or
dried herrings.&nbsp; The people were terrified, and the nobles
began to bestir themselves; they sent out armed men in well-built
boats, headed by an able leader, and desired them to bring in the
monster prisoner; but the lord of the Maelstrom, so far from
being brought to consent to this arrangement, exactly reversed
the orders of the Norwegian ministry, for he sunk all their
boats, and carried their crews prisoners to his island.&nbsp;
Frotho heard this pitiful tale with much indifference, till they
besought him to go in person against their enemy, well knowing
that no magic or infernal power could succeed against the race of
Odin;&mdash;<a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>then he sprung up in alarm, and declining, in his own
person, all pretensions to superior sanctity, sent one of his
best generals with a band of his own chosen troops, in two
gallant vessels, to seize or destroy the monster.&nbsp; All
Norway assembled on the coast to witness their success; they saw
the ships sail gallantly on, and, on the opposite coast, the
giant monster rush into the waves to meet them.&nbsp; With a
strength against which they could not contend, he seized the
luckless vessels, drew them coolly and steadily on to the
frightful gulf of the Maelstrom, and then, swimming back to his
island, left the noble ships to be sucked into the frightful
bosom of the gulf.&nbsp; The waves swept over them, and the tale
of their deeds was told.</p>
<p>Frotho was frightened into sobriety when this news reached
him; Denmark became as clamorous as Norway in the matter, and he
was compelled to promise that he would exert his sanctity, and go
in person to the attack of the monster: but he delayed as long as
he possibly could, and, under pretence of making preparations,
gave the fiend of the Maelstrom time to eat half the children in
Norway.&nbsp; At length &ldquo;delays became dangerous&rdquo;
even to Frotho himself; he was obliged to depart, and, well
armed, well guarded, and well attended <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>by a
resolute band of the bravest of his nobles and chiefs, set sail,
on a fine sunny day, for the desolate isle of the
Maelstrom.&nbsp; His magnanimous majesty could not, however, help
shivering at the first glance of the island; but he took courage,
on remarking that the beast did not come out to meet him, nor
advance to the attack as in the former instance; so he landed in
good spirits on the island, promising himself immortal glory in
his conquest.&nbsp; A sufficient band was left in charge of the
vessels, and Frotho, with his chiefs, went boldly forward into
the island.</p>
<p>In the first few miles there was nothing to astonish them;
rugged rocks, a roaring sea, and desolate naked heaths, were all
that greeted the travellers: they had expected nothing else, for
the Moskoe was well known to most of the party, and had never
been suspected of sheltering a paradise in its bosom.&nbsp; Such,
however, to their boundless astonishment, the heroes now found to
be the case.&nbsp; A beautiful country arose amidst the desolate
isle; and, after the first five miles, hills, dales, fertile
valleys, richly wooded groves, and sparkling rivers, said a
thousand smiling good-morrows to the travellers.&nbsp; The scene
was too charming to terrify, else the total absence of any thing
like human inhabitants might have <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>been sufficient to startle king
Frotho, and make him doubt whether all was as it should be in
this particular part of his dominion.&nbsp; There was a total
silence around them, unbroken, save by the sweet warblings of
birds, or now and then the light foot of the flying deer, as,
scared by the clatter of their arms, they fled from them into the
forests.&nbsp; Thus they proceeded till they arrived before the
gates of a majestic palace of black marble, whose open portals
courteously invited them to enter.&nbsp; Frotho paused&mdash;so
did his nobles; it was finer than any thing in Denmark;
infinitely larger, grander, bolder, blacker, than the palace of
Sandaal, the royal residence of king Frotho himself,&mdash;so
that it was clear no human hands had reared it: but whose hands
had?&mdash;a puzzling question, which king Frotho would not take
upon himself to answer.</p>
<p>But the portals stood invitingly wide open, and king Frotho
was waxing weary; so, without any further debate or permission
demanded, they marched into a stately hall, where invisible cooks
had made successful preparation for a magnificent supper; Frotho
looked and longed.&nbsp; There was venison, noble venison of the
flesh of the elk, roasted wild boar, and a cistern of excellent
fish delicately stewed in whale fat; there was a bowl <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>of
hydromel, in which king Frotho might have been drowned, and
another of milk, that might have served him for a bath:&mdash;in
short, the temptation was too great for the tempted; and though
king Frotho well knew the danger incurred, even by a son of Odin,
in tasting enchanted food, yet he could not resist the whale fat
and the hydromel.&nbsp; &ldquo;The monster certainly expected
me,&rdquo; said he to his attendants.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is willing
to make his peace with you,&rdquo; said they to the king.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It would be uncivil not to taste his good cheer,&rdquo;
said the master.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us shew that we accept his
submission,&rdquo; replied the servants.&nbsp; So they all sat
down with one accord to the feast, and ate, and drank, and were
merry.</p>
<p>The bowl of hydromel was empty&mdash;Frotho was looking into
it disconsolately with one eye (for the other was asleep), and
growing angry with his nobles, who had assisted him too heartily,
and been over-zealous in obeying his commands to pledge him to
the health of their entertainer.&nbsp; After grumbling and
growling for some time over the huge and now dismal-looking bowl,
his majesty took it into his head to be displeased with the
inattention of his host, who had failed to remark and replenish,
as he ought to have done, the empty bowl of departed
hydromel.&nbsp; <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>&ldquo;Lord beast of the island,&rdquo; said his
majesty, at length, having thought till his thirst grew
intolerable; &ldquo;lord beast of the island, I will permit thee
to be viceroy in Moskoe, but thou must not spare thy hydromel
when thy master deigns to visit thee.&nbsp; For thy good cheer, I
thank thee; thy meat is of the best, and abundant, but, by the
burning wheel on Balder&rsquo;s breast, thy drink was scanty; and
I command thee hither to supply me with more.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
rumbling of thunder and a long terrific howl was the answer to
the speech of the monarch.&nbsp; Frotho shivered with affright,
for he thought he recognised, amid the uproar, the voices of his
old acquaintances the illustrious snake and wolf, cousins of his
sorcerer friend Biorno; and, as he was a little diffident of
their conduct, notwithstanding his services to Surter, he did not
altogether relish the meeting, under present circumstances; so,
ensconcing himself in the centre of his gallant little band of
valiant warriors, he patiently awaited what was to be the second
part of his entertainment.&nbsp; This was settled in an instant;
neither Fenris nor Midgard broke upon the supper party of the
monarch, but a being more horrible than either, and infinitely
more hideous than his or any imagination had already conceived of
the monster of the <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>Maelstrom gulf.&nbsp; A stern gigantic shape entered
the hall, and stood steadily face to face with king Frotho and
his nobles: his features were frightfully flat, and two sunken
fiery eyes shot terrific glances from a visage almost entirely
covered with dark and grisly hair; long black elf locks hung down
upon his shoulders, huge teeth grinned through his grisly beard,
and his fingers and feet were furnished with claws which were
worthy of Nebuchadnezzar himself; his enormous body was covered
with black bear-skins, so disposed as to serve him for a whole
suit; and his huge hand grasped a monstrous club, which seemed
very desirous of a nearer acquaintance with his majesty of
Denmark&rsquo;s brains.&nbsp; The monster contemplated the group
for a moment in silence; he suffered them even to draw their
swords and advance exactly one step towards him, when he suddenly
lifted his terrible club, and, without striking a single blow,
laid them all prostrate at his feet.&nbsp; He then approached
king Frotho; the son of Olave shrunk from the uplifted club, and
bellowed out, in terror and haste, that he was the king of
Denmark.&nbsp; &ldquo;And thy errand?&rdquo; said the
monster.&nbsp; King Frotho was silent.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
it,&rdquo; observed the spectre; &ldquo;and for its presumption,
but for one thing which I <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>expect of thee, would bind thy
trembling feet for ever to the spot where thou standest staring
at me.&nbsp; Hark thee! thou fool of Surter&rsquo;s making! who
hopest to overcome the invincible by human arms,&mdash;hear, and
obey what I shall command thee.&nbsp; I do not hate thee, and
would not harm thee, for thou art the friend of Lok; but my wrath
against the kingdoms must be appeased, and my divinity
acknowledged.&nbsp; I demand thy daughter.&nbsp; A spotless
virgin of royal blood must come voluntarily hither to be
sacrificed on this island, and thou must conduct her: do this,
and henceforth I too am thy friend; neglect it, and my thunders
shall shake thy palace of Sandaal, and this club dash out thy
brains and scatter them over thy sovereign throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King Frotho looked aghast&mdash;not at the condition of his
safety, but his utter inability to fulfil it&mdash;there was no
cheating such an enemy as this&mdash;so he told him the plain
truth, that he had no daughter, and humbly apologised for the
want of one.&nbsp; The monster yelled at him, and again lifted up
his club.&nbsp; Frotho, in agony, besought him to have pity, and
then suddenly recollected that he had a niece who was his
prisoner, and whom he very readily offered to his disposal.&nbsp;
The monster hesitated;&mdash;at length, in reply to <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>Frotho&rsquo;s earnest entreaties, he consented to
spare his life, upon condition that, in the space of twenty days,
he should land the princess on the island, and deliver her safely
into his hands, to be sacrificed by his own high priest in his
palace; and promising, should Frotho fail in his engagement, on
the very next day, to shake Sandaal about his ears, and dish up
his carcass as a meal for Midgard.&nbsp; Frotho sealed his
promise with a solemn oath, and the monster dismissed him with a
kick on the throne-honouring part of his person, which sent him
not only through the palace gates, but one mile forward in his
journey to the coast, which long before he had gained, his
panting train overtook him, being driven out by the lord beast,
to wait upon and console their disgraced and afflicted
master.</p>
<p>King Frotho had no intention, rogue as he was, to cozen the
Moskoe monster; on the contrary, he was desirous to obtain his
friendship and forbearance towards his subjects and the little
Norwegian children for whom he had evinced such cannibal
prepossessions.&nbsp; He was not sorry, either, so effectually to
dispose of Ildegarda, whose union with his son he had such good
reason to fear.&nbsp; The difficulty would be to persuade the
princess to go voluntarily to be <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>eaten.&nbsp; He was ingenious
however&mdash;naturally fertile in expedients&mdash;and he soon
hit upon a method of persuasion which he deemed infallible: he
told the poor princess that the monster demanded her or her
father as prisoners; that he allowed her to choose, and if she
thought proper to decline, he should ship off old Haquin
immediately, to be stewed in whale fat, and served up for supper
with milk sauce, according to the pleasure of the monster, in the
marble palace of Moskoe: for his own part, in relation to
herself, he pretended he did not clearly understand to what the
lord of the island had destined her, but he hoped nothing so
terrible as a roast or a hash.&nbsp; Ildegarda wept, but came
into the scheme quicker than Frotho had anticipated.&nbsp;
Haldane was dead, and her father&rsquo;s life in danger; by the
sacrifice of her own, which was now really become indifferent to
her, she could at least preserve the last of these beloved
beings, and therefore she did not hesitate.&nbsp; Making Frotho
swear a tremendous oath (which she knew no Dane dared break), to
release her father on his return from Moskoe, she prepared to
accompany the king, and, in less than twenty days, Frotho and his
beautiful victim landed on the island, and prepared to march to
the black palace alone.</p>
<p><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>They
had not proceeded far on their journey, when their progress was
arrested by the appearance of a singular cavalcade coming to meet
them; this consisted of a magnificently painted chariot, drawn by
four snow-white rein-deer, each of whom, to the astonishment of
Ildegarda, had feet of pure gold: behind it came the monster-man
himself, mounted upon a coal-black steed of extraordinary size
and beauty, who pawed the earth impatiently, and, snorting and
foaming as he reared, threw his magnificent mane from side to
side, as if weary of the slight restraint which his rider
appeared to impose upon him;&mdash;the latter had now a bear-skin
cap upon his head, on the top of which sat a monstrous raven,
decorating it by way of crest; and another on his wrist, with
infinite grace and gravity, seemed ready to serve him in quality
of falcon extraordinary.&nbsp; The cavalcade paused on remarking
the strangers; and the grim monster, advancing to Frotho, sternly
demanded, &ldquo;Comes the maid willingly?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;She does,&rdquo; replied Frotho;
&ldquo;and&rdquo;&mdash;But the monster no longer gave him any
attention: he did not even look at Ildegarda, but, bending his
head down towards his horse&rsquo;s ears, gravely and mildly
asked, &ldquo;Steed of heaven, art thou weary?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>horse; &ldquo;but I have to-day been
so long upon the earth, that its gross air is beginning to affect
me&mdash;the sod is heavy to my feet, and somewhat checks my
swiftness: let me relieve my legs, I pray thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
strange monster nodded his grisly head in reply, and Frotho
beheld the courser slowly and deliberately draw up his four black
legs, and let down three white ones in their places.&nbsp; The
king began now to guess his company; &ldquo;It is the wondrous
steed of Odin,&rdquo; said he in a whisper to Ildegarda;
&ldquo;the immortal eight-legged Sleipner: but what is he who
rides him?&rdquo;&nbsp; The princess had no time to answer this
question, even had she been able, for the monster seemed
determined to have all the conversation to himself.&nbsp; He
spoke to the raven on his head: &ldquo;Hugo,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;take the reins, guide my rein-deer smoothly, and conduct
the lady to the palace: and you, Mumin,&rdquo; added he to the
bird on his wrist, &ldquo;hasten homewards, and see that all be
prepared for the victim.&rdquo;&nbsp; At these terrible words,
the tears of Ildegarda began to flow, and Frotho prepared himself
to make a speech.&nbsp; The monster heeded neither the one nor
the other, but nodded to Ildegarda to ascend the chariot, which
when she had done, he turned round to Frotho, lifted up his
terrible club, and exclaimed, <a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>in a voice of thunder,
&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was but one word, but the tone and the
action weighed more than five hundred with Frotho, who, fearing
to hear it repeated, darted from the party, and set sail for
Denmark without once looking behind him.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Ildegarda was conducted by her ill-looking
escort to the marble palace, and left by him in the same hall in
which Frotho had rested on his first arrival: here, too, she
found a supper prepared for her, though in a somewhat different
taste from the former; but the princess had no inclination to
eat&mdash;indeed she felt determined not to be fattened before
killing, and threw herself upon the earth in a paroxysm of grief
and despair.&nbsp; Suddenly, soft and sweet music broke upon her
ear, and the beautiful voice of some holy unseen thing thus sung
soothingly to her sorrow:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">When the thunder-bolt cleaveth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The trembling sky&mdash;<br />
When the mad ocean heaveth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His wild waves on high&mdash;<br />
When the coiling snake waketh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the heaving earth curled,<br />
And upreareth and shaketh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An agonised world&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>When his coil thrice he foldeth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the night-born,<br />
Till the gazer beholdeth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Red blood fill her horn&mdash;<br />
When Valkyries scatter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The clouds which they tear,<br />
And their steed hoof&rsquo;s loud clatter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is heard in the air&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">When on oak tops the tramping<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of their hoofs echo loud,<br />
While their snorting and champing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is lost in the cloud&mdash;<br />
When wizards are breaking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sleep of the dead,<br />
And the shadows are waking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From each gory bed&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">When the dog of hell howleth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the sheeted dead glide<br />
Where the queen of death scowleth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grim Fenris beside&mdash;<br />
When Surter assembleth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lost round his throne&mdash;<br />
Then the murderer trembleth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the murderer alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">But then, guiltless beauty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What hast thou to fear?<br />
All owe thee their duty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All homage thee here;<br />
<a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>The life
thou hast given<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The immortals will claim;<br />
And Rinda in heaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stamps thy star-written name.</p>
<p>The princess listened in breathless astonishment, and, when
the sweet sounds died away, spoke in cheerful tones to the
friendly singer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks, gentle magician,&rdquo;
said she aloud; &ldquo;I submit to the pleasure of Odin, and will
not be ungrateful for thy anxiety; see, I will partake of thy
hospitality, and then retire to rest confident in thy gracious
protection.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda then ate something of the
repast, and the moment she had concluded, the dishes and bowls
retired of themselves from the table, without any assistance,
through the doors and windows of the palace.&nbsp; While she was
lost in astonishment at this singular attendance, the doors on
the opposite side of the hall opened of themselves, and she,
supposing it a summons for her attention, immediately passed
through them, and heard them close behind her.&nbsp; She
traversed several stately rooms, till at length she stood in one
more magnificent than the rest, and which, from the circumstance
of the doors closing when she entered it, she concluded was
designed by her host for her chamber.&nbsp; Grateful for his
indulgence, <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>she determined to accept his courtesy, and threw
herself down upon her couch to sleep: satisfied, she reviewed the
events of the day, and found she had little reason to
complain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could even be happy,&rdquo; said
Ildegarda, &ldquo;if I were assured of the safety of my
father.&rdquo;&nbsp; The wish was instantly gratified; a large
curtain on the opposite side was suddenly withdrawn, and,
represented on a magic mirror, the princess beheld her father in
his own palace, conversing earnestly with his attendants.&nbsp;
The vision lasted but a few moments&mdash;the curtain fell again
before the mirror, and Ildegarda, in a transport of gratitude,
thanked aloud the courteous monster, who thus sought, as he had
promised, to offer her the homage most pleasing to her
feelings.</p>
<p>Ildegarda now tried to compose her spirits to sleep,&mdash;the
pale moon had risen over the island, and was pouring a flood of
calm cold light into each apartment of the
palace,&mdash;suddenly, her beams were eclipsed by a light so
glorious that the senses of the princess ached as she
contemplated the wonder; she looked up to discover the cause, but
mortality drooped under its excess of glory, and she bent
downwards towards the earth; a soft voice called upon her name,
but the princess could not reply; then the beautiful <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>being, who
was resting upon the light, beheld the embarrassment of her
beloved, and, dismissing part of the effulgence by which she was
surrounded, stood visible to the mortal sight, and Ildegarda
beheld her beloved goddess, the guardian of her youth, the divine
object of her innocent worship, the radiant Rinda, the daughter
of the sun, the beloved of Odin and Freya.</p>
<p>Ildegarda bent her brow still lower to the earth, and kissed
the fringe of the mantle of her goddess; then the most lovely of
those lovely beings, who float on their ether thrones round the
domes of Valasciolf, spoke tenderly to the fairest of her
worshippers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou hast done well and wisely,&rdquo;
said the daughter of heaven to the child of earth, &ldquo;in thus
offering thy life for thy father and thy country, and thou hast
not disappointed my hope; I carried up the perfume of the holy
deed to the foot of the throne of Odin; pleased, he took it from
my hand, clothed it in light, and placing it on a branch of
Hydrasil, the tree of heaven, bade it blow and expand into an
immortal flower, to commemorate thy virtue, and remind him of thy
deserving.&nbsp; Child of my love&mdash;hope all&mdash;fear
nothing&mdash;endure with patience&mdash;and thy reward shall be
most glorious.&rdquo;&nbsp; The goddess then recalled around <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>her the
extended beams of light, and, concentrating their brightness
round her person, again became insupportably effulgent to human
vision; in the next instant she was gone, and the glory she had
left died away when unfed by her presence.</p>
<p>How sweet was the sleep of Ildegarda that night, and how
blessed was her awakening on the morrow!&nbsp; Morning, the gay
bride of Balder, beheld her descend joyfully to the hall, after
adorning her lovely person with an elegant dress, selected from
many, which the unseen hands of her watchful attendants had
placed in her apartment for that purpose.&nbsp; Arrived in the
hall, she expressed a wish to breakfast; and instantly the
courteous dishes glided in from doors and windows to the table,
attended by a grave-looking bowl of milk, which steadily sailed
on till it placed itself in the centre, where it remained till
the princess, by rising from table, dismissed its services for
the present.&nbsp; She then roamed through the vast gardens of
this beautiful place, and talked to the birds and the deer,
fondly hoping and expecting that they were enchanted princes and
princesses, and, like the black horse whom she beheld on her
arrival, endowed with the faculty of speech; but, after much
conversation on her own part, she was compelled to <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>resign this
pleasing illusion, and believe that they were merely real birds
and real deer, who could only sing and leap.&nbsp; She then
returned to the palace, wandered over its spacious apartments,
and amused herself by counting the passages and doors.&nbsp;
Still the day went off heavily, even with the aid of these
time-killing pastimes; and when the hour of supper arrived, the
princess welcomed it as sincerely as if hunger had been the
instigator of the pleasure her countenance expressed; she seated
herself at the table, and was earnestly and anxiously employed in
coaxing the birds to partake of it,&mdash;when a loud clap of
thunder shook the palace to its foundation, and terrified all
appetite from the poor princess.&nbsp; She had hardly time to
think of its cause, ere it became apparent, for the monster-man
himself entered the hall, and, clad in his customary dress, stood
still in the middle of the apartment.&nbsp; Although his
appearance was as usual, yet his manner was entirely different,
for his step was slow and irresolute, and his voice mild and
timid; he scarcely ventured to look up as he asked, in a humble
and supplicating manner, if the princess would permit him to pay
his duty while she supped.&nbsp; Ildegarda, somewhat re-assured
by his gentleness, requested him to use his pleasure in a place
<a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>where
unquestionably all things were at his disposal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
so, gracious lady,&rdquo; replied the courteous monster; &ldquo;I
will not stay in your presence, but with your express permission:
my power I cede to your beauty and virtue, and am content myself
to be the first subject of so lovely a sovereign.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This gallant speech was made with so much humility and respect,
that Ildegarda was not alarmed by its tenderness; and the
monster, to shew (after she had granted permission) how highly he
valued this trifling favour, and how little he was disposed to
encroachment, declined the seat which, after a struggle, she
offered him, and seated himself upon the ground, at a
considerable distance from her.&nbsp; Touched by this humble
homage and generous delicacy of a being so powerful, and at whose
mercy she so entirely was, the princess so far conquered her
abhorrence, as to present him with food and drink; the former he
declined, but he took the again-summoned bowl of milk from her
snowy hand, and, with a gesture of respectful gratitude, tasted
the balmy liquor, as if to indulge her wish.&nbsp; At length,
after a long silence, he asked her if she could be happy in the
island?&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; replied the princess;
&ldquo;but will you tell me, sir sorcerer, what has thus
singularly <a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>changed my destiny?&nbsp; I came hither to
die&mdash;yet I live,&mdash;and anxiety is even manifested by my
enemy for my happiness.&nbsp; How am I to understand these
contradictions?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Call me not your enemy,
beautiful Ildegarda,&rdquo; replied the monster, &ldquo;for that
I have not been; destiny had decreed you to be a victim, though
not of death; I am but its instrument to work out its intentions;
the sacrifice of your liberty only was demanded, and your
generous resignation of life itself has impelled me to love your
worth, and lighten, as far as my power will, the burthen of your
sorrows.&nbsp; I cannot release you from this rock, but I can
surround you with pleasures, and render your bondage
supportable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda was pleased with this
explanation, and, after thanking her host for his generous
intentions, withdrew to her chamber, though not till she had
accorded to Brandomann (for that he had told her was his name)
permission to attend her on the next evening to supper: this was
an honour she would gladly have declined,&mdash;but she felt it
would be ungracious, and that he had some right to calculate upon
her complaisance.&nbsp; The next night came, and Brandomann was
punctual&mdash;conducting himself in the same timid
manner&mdash;though, observing the dislike of Ildegarda towards
<a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>him, he
put an end to the interview earlier than usual, and quitted her
presence in sorrow.&nbsp; The princess was sad that she had
inflicted pain, yet she could not but hope that the hideous being
would not again seek her society.&nbsp; In this she was
disappointed;&mdash;he came at night, as before, and seated
himself silent and sorrowfully at her feet; he spoke not, and
scarcely ventured to look at her, till she, affected by his
griefs offered him the bowl and bade him drink; he took it with a
smile&mdash;the poor monster intended it so, but the frightful
grin which distorted his features was so odious, that Ildegarda
sickened with affright, and heartily repented her
condescension.&nbsp; Brandomann understood her disgust.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ildegarda,&rdquo; he said, mournfully, &ldquo;I too well
know how justly I must be an object of abhorrence to the eye of
beauty; I will not give you pain therefore&mdash;though it will
destroy the only happiness I have ever enjoyed, I will intrude no
more into your presence,&mdash;I will not destroy the little
felicity which fate has left you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He arose to
retire; but the generosity of the princess overcame her
reluctance,&mdash;she was not proof against this noble
self-denial,&mdash;and, rising hastily from her seat, she
requested, entreated,&mdash;nay, commanded him to continue his
visits.&nbsp; Brandomann was but too <a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>happy to obey; and he retired
comforted from her presence.&nbsp; The next night Brandomann was
not so silent&mdash;he exerted himself to amuse and interest his
lovely prisoner; and he succeeded admirably when he spoke of the
present state of Denmark&mdash;the disorders of the
king&mdash;the disappearance of both the princes, sons of
Harold&mdash;and the courage and integrity of her noble father;
upon this theme he discoursed till tears of pleasure filled the
eyes of the princess, whom he repeatedly assured of
Haquin&rsquo;s safety.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should you wish a
confirmation of the intelligence which I give you,&rdquo;
continued Brandomann, &ldquo;on the first day of every month
examine the magic mirror in your chamber; it will satisfy your
curiosity, by representing your father and his employments; but
only at that time must you consult it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still
Brandomann continued to talk, and Ildegarda to listen, till she
forgot to wish for the hour of separation, and even suffered the
monster to retire first; the next day she grew weary ere evening,
and waited with something like impatience for the supper hour: it
came at last, and Brandomann with it, who perceived, by the
reception she gave him, that he was no longer so unwelcome a
guest as formerly.&nbsp; Animated by this belief, he again
exerted all his <a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>powers to interest the princess; he related to her the
early history of her country, and the exploits of the greatest
heroes, her ancestors of the race of Odin; he then went on to
discourse of the Scaldres, their singular union, their mystic
occupations, and their magnificent poems; he himself, he remarked
to her, was of this privileged order, and, without wearying her
attention, recited some of his own compositions and those of his
noble brethren.&nbsp; Ildegarda was charmed by his
discourses.&nbsp; Balder had touched his lips with eloquence, and
Brage had rendered his voice melodious, and many words flowed
over his lips, sweet, yet powerful, as a torrent of silvery
waters.&nbsp; The princess was pleased while she only
listened,&mdash;when she looked, the spell was broken.</p>

<blockquote><p>Misery acquaints a man with strange
Bedfellows.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>&mdash;<i>Tempest</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Day</span> after day thus glided on
without much variation, though not so heavily as formerly.&nbsp;
One evening Brandomann said to her, &ldquo;Your mornings must
still be wearisome to you; perhaps it might give you pleasure to
travel around this little island; when such shall be your wish,
summon aloud your carriage, with the snow-white deer, (that which
brought you hither,) and it will instantly attend your
command.&rdquo;&nbsp; The princess was impatient, till the next
morning gave her an opportunity of indulging this new
pleasure;&mdash;for when our pleasures are few, every little
variation is hailed as a new one;&mdash;she sprung lightly from
her couch, and, with beaming eyes and a throbbing heart, ascended
her chariot, which, at <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>her wish, waited at the gates of the
marble palace.&nbsp; For some hours she was delighted to be borne
swiftly by the coursers of light through flowery vales and
blooming gardens; but at length grew weary of the silence and
monotony which every where surrounded her, and the inability to
utter or reply to an observation.&nbsp; The deer looked at her
with their intelligent eyes, and seemed to understand her
feelings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, turn then, my lovely deer,&rdquo; she
replied in answer to their silent interrogatory; &ldquo;bear me
again to my home.&rdquo;&nbsp; She entered the marble hall.&nbsp;
It was many days since she no longer startled at the clap of
thunder which announced the approach of Brandomann, and now she
heard it with pleasure.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have been amused
to-day,&rdquo; said he to her as he entered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
much,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;although I blush to say so; I
would be happy if I could, yet I cannot help feeling that
solitude is melancholy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas! yes,&rdquo;
replied the lord of the Maelstrom; &ldquo;but there are
companions to whom it is preferable.&nbsp; If I did not fear
offending by my presumption&rdquo;&mdash;He was eagerly
interrupted by Ildegarda, who accepted the embryo offer with
delight; and her manner had such an effect upon the monster, that
again the princess repented her condescension.&nbsp; He made
ample amends for his <a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>hideous joy, however, on the
following day, when attending Ildegarda on her journey, by his
timid and gentle modesty.&nbsp; Mounted on his coal-black steed,
he respectfully followed her brilliant chariot, and never, except
in answer to her summons, ventured to approach her side.&nbsp;
The princess was naturally generous, and this conduct secured her
confidence.&nbsp; She now encouraged him to converse, called him
frequently to her side, and took pleasure in calling forth and
listening to his observations.&nbsp; On their return to the
palace, a huge raven flew down from a tree upon the shoulder of
Brandomann, and whispered something in his ear; the latter
immediately turned to Ildegarda: &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;the only friends who ever enliven this solitude by
visiting me, are now on the island; will you permit them to
attend you at supper?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda consented joyfully:
the thought of once more seeing human beings filled her spirit
with rapture; and, hastening to her apartment, she spent the
intervening time in dressing her lovely person to the utmost
advantage, not only for her own sake, but also to do honour to
the taste and generosity of Brandomann, who had been most lavish
in his preparations for her toilet.&nbsp; At length she
descended, and, with a palpitating heart, entered the hall.&nbsp;
<a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>At the
door she was met by Brandomann himself, who courteously led her
forward to present her to his guests&mdash;they rose to receive
her&mdash;but imagine the astonishment of Ildegarda!&mdash;No
words can do justice to her surprise, as she surveyed the
assembled party: neither knight nor lady, spirit nor fiend,
greeted her entrance,&mdash;but on one side stood an enormous
wild boar&mdash;on the other a beautiful white she-goat&mdash;in
front stood the eight-legged steed of Odin&mdash;and the two
ravens, whom she had seen on her landing on the island, had
perched themselves with infinite gravity upon Brandomann&rsquo;s
club.&nbsp; The princess turned to her friend, and was about to
demand an explanation, when she was prevented by the beautiful
goat, who, with an air at once kind and dignified, welcomed her
to the island, which she said was happy under the government of
the good Brandomann, the favourite of Odin, and whom all good
spirits loved: the boar made her his best bow&mdash;Sleipner
assured her of his devotion&mdash;the ravens were happy in the
honour of her acquaintance&mdash;and Ildegarda, after replying to
each of these extraordinary visitors, recovered something of her
composure, and smilingly sat down to supper with her
company.&nbsp; She was about to apologise for the want of proper
fare, when she beheld them <a name="page289"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>supplied with their own particular
dishes by the same unseen attendants who so assiduously waited
upon her.&nbsp; Oats and hay, in a silver manger, were placed
before Sleipner&mdash;a huge tray of nuts and acorns sallied in,
and stood stationary at the tusks of the boar&mdash;a salad was
the supper of the white goat&mdash;and a raw rump steak was
provided for the accommodation of the ravens.&nbsp; The princess
began to be amused with her situation and company, and listen to
their conversation with considerable interest: Mumin and Hugo,
the raven messengers of Odin, were talking over some of the
divinities of Asgard; and Sleipner mentioned a journey which Thor
the Thunderer intended shortly to take upon his back, to correct
the impious inhabitants of Jutland, who, since the ascension of
the murderer Feggo to his brother&rsquo;s throne, had totally
neglected his worship.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is the murdered prince in
Asgard?&rdquo; demanded Brandomann.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has a
magnificent palace in Valasciolf,&rdquo; replied the huge boar,
&ldquo;where he resides among the other heroes and the divine
family and ministers of Odin, and with them usually spends his
nights at the banquet in Valhalla; but he is not a favourite
warrior there: if he was no more amiable on earth than he is in
heaven, I am not surprised <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>at his wife&rsquo;s wishing to get
rid of him.&nbsp; Hamlet is also there, and almost as unpopular
as his father.&nbsp; Can you imagine it possible, he spends all
his time with Forsete at Glitner, and has grown so wise and
disputacious, that he is continually instructing Odin himself;
nay, the other morning, just before the sounding for the combat,
he spoke so learnedly to that blind Horror, whom we dare not name
out of heaven, and who is already sufficiently inclined to
mischief, that Thor, provoked, lifted up his mallet to knock out
the shadow of his brains,&mdash;but Balder interfered, and his
eloquence and Lofna&rsquo;s smile restored peace to
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how go on the happy Scaldres?&rdquo; demanded
Brandomann; &ldquo;what is become of the unlucky Hiarn, whose
skill in singing gained him a crown?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
singer-in-chief in Valhalla,&rdquo; replied Sleipner; &ldquo;and
indeed his strains well deserve this distinction.&nbsp; But
see,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;the princess looks to you for an
explanation: take your harp, Brandomann, and let it tell the
story of Hiarn.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I obey you,&rdquo; replied
the lord of the Maelstrom; and he caught up his harp and
sung&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry"><a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>THE LEGEND
OF HIARN.</p>
<p class="poetry">The heart of the monarch was savage and
wild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his red hand with life-blood was gory;<br />
He spared not the matron, he spared not the child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Proud youth, nor the head that was hoary.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Hiarn arose&mdash;and his melody&rsquo;s
voice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As over the wild harp it swept,<br />
Brought relief to the land, bade its nobles rejoice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the dark monarch listened&mdash;and wept!</p>
<p class="poetry">And his sorrow was holy, for into his heart<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those tones tender pity had flung&mdash;<br />
And Fate whisper&rsquo;d, &ldquo;Thy soul shall with music
depart&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So he died, while the sweet harper sung.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Hiarn was king&mdash;for the fierce nobles
came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Subdued by his powers alone,<br />
They crowned his bright brow, proclaimed his great name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lowlily knelt at his throne.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Hiarn was king, and&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alackaday!&rdquo; said the boar, who did not appear to
have any very great taste for music, and who was beginning
besides to be weary of Brandomann&rsquo;s dismal ditty;
&ldquo;alas! for the poor harper; it is a pity, after such a
glorious opening, the close of his history should have been so
dismal.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; demanded
Ildegarda; &ldquo;tell <a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>me, I pray you, what was the fate of
Hiarn?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A prince of the blood,&rdquo; replied
the courteous boar, &ldquo;the warrior Fridleff, who did not
understand music, challenged the crown from Hiarn: he was too
good a musician to make any thing but a contemptible soldier, so,
as might have been expected, he sunk under the first blow of
Fridleff.&nbsp; But, grieve not for him, charming princess, he is
well rewarded for his short period of suffering; a throne in
Asgard&mdash;a palace dome in Valasciolf&mdash;are surely higher
blessings than even reigning in
Denmark&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Serimnor!&rdquo; said the white goat,
interrupting the conversation, and pointing with her horns to the
stars, which were now rapidly gemming the heavens; &ldquo;see,
the lights in the palaces of Asgard are lit&mdash;the deities and
heroes are on their way to Valhalla&mdash;let us not keep them
waiting, but hasten to supper, lest we should offend the Highest
by our presumption.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus saying, she departed, after
a friendly good-night to the princess, and a promise to spend
many evenings with her in the island.&nbsp; Serimnor, deeply
engaged at that moment in a dispute with Brandomann about the
politics of Jutland, did not remark her departure, but was
reminded of it, to the no small astonishment of Ildegarda, in a
very extraordinary <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>manner; a gigantic pair of hands, the right brandishing
an enormous carving knife, coolly entered the folding doors, and,
seizing the throat of the luckless Serimnor, without any sort of
notice or preparation, cut it from one side to the other, just as
he was pronouncing the names of Harwendil and Feggo, which, from
the suddenness of this man&oelig;uvre, burst through the gaping
orifice in his throat, instead of by the usual channel of
communication&mdash;the mouth.&nbsp; The terror of Ildegarda, who
had begun to esteem the polite and obliging Serimnor, was greatly
increased by the extraordinary coolness of Brandomann, who stood
looking on as if nothing particular had happened, and only
discontinued his speech when the body of the poor boar was
dragged from the apartment by the murderous pair of hands.&nbsp;
It seemed as if the whole party had been in a conspiracy to
frighten the timid Ildegarda; for, on the disappearance of the
boar, Sleipner started up, and, snorting till fire darted from
his nostrils and eyes, sprung up into the air, and pawing, and
dashing, and foaming, ascended up to the clouds through the roof
of the palace, which parted to give him passage,&mdash;while the
two ravens flew screaming out of the window.&nbsp; Brandomann had
disappeared in the bustle, and, <a name="page294"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>as he did not attend her on the
following morning, she waited with much uneasy impatience for an
explanation in the evening: this was given by the good-natured
boar himself, who had marked her anxiety, and hurried first to
the palace in order to relieve it.&nbsp; He thanked her for the
interest she took in what appeared to be his suffering;
&ldquo;But grieve not, loveliest of maidens,&rdquo; said the
gallant beast, &ldquo;at an event which is to me but the
consummation of my glory: every night thus I die without pain,
and my flesh is served up to the banquet of the gods,&mdash;while
my spirit enjoys a blissful sleep, from which it awakes in the
morning to animate the same form in which it was clothed the day
before.&nbsp; The beautiful goat whom you saw, is the immortal
Heidruna, whose milk is the hydromel served up to the table of
Odin.&nbsp; She alone, last night, was punctual to her
engagement, while the rest of the party, enchanted by your
beauty, forgot the hour, and had some difficulty to reach
Valhalla in time to avoid the reproach of Odin.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Scarcely was this explanation given, ere Heidruna herself
entered, attended by the ravens and Sleipner, who apologised for
their hasty departure the evening before; and a moment after, the
clap of thunder announced the approach of Brandomann.&nbsp; The
whole party now sat contentedly <a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>down to supper, infinitely pleased
with themselves and each other; and perhaps it would have been
difficult to find one more happy, or its members bearing more
sincere good will towards each other.&nbsp; The next day was the
first of the month, and the princess hastened to avail herself of
the magic gift of Brandomann.&nbsp; With intense anxiety she
raised the curtain, and her heart throbbed with delight to behold
her father in health and spirits, well armed, and travelling,
attended by a band of gallant warriors, who appeared to be
anxious for his safety.&nbsp; Ildegarda looked at him with
rapture, and new feelings of gratitude to Brandomann gave the
evening which followed this happy morning, fresh charms in her
eyes, and made her confinement in the desolate island, with none
but the ugliest of orangutangs for a constant companion, no
longer either gloomy or dreadful.</p>
<p>One morning, while surveying together the beauties of the
island in a sentimental walk, Brandomann asked the princess if
she had now entirely resigned herself to the lot of total
seclusion in the island of the Maelstrom.&nbsp; &ldquo;I may, and
do sometimes regret the halls of my fathers,&rdquo; replied the
tender Ildegarda.&nbsp; &ldquo;But when I reflect from what
miseries my devotion has preserved <a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>my beloved country, and still more
beloved father, I feel that I ought not to complain.&nbsp;
Neither am I insensible of what I owe to you; and I acknowledge
that, without any other motive, your generous protection of me
and care of my happiness deserves the sacrifice even of these
regrets: I am willing to make it, and should even rejoice in an
opportunity that would allow me to convince you of my
sincerity.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have, then, (and permit me to
say I hope it,) banished from your heart the remembrance of
Haldane?&rdquo; said the monster.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas! no,&rdquo;
replied Ildegarda, bursting into tears of tenderness at his
recollection; &ldquo;that can I never do; and it is the certainty
of his loss that enables me so well to support this destiny: but
do not let this disturb you&mdash;the recollection of Haldane
will never interrupt my gratitude to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And
you could resolve upon fresh sacrifices if they were demanded of
you?&rdquo; inquired Brandomann.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could,&rdquo;
replied the princess.&nbsp; Brandomann paused&mdash;he looked
sadly and earnestly at Ildegarda, and then, as with a violent
effort, flung himself at her feet, and tremblingly demanded,
&ldquo;Princess, will you become my wife?&rdquo;&nbsp; A shriek
of horror, and a look of unmeasured abhorrence, was the only
reply of the hapless Ildegarda; and too <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>plainly
these tokens spoke to the unfortunate Brandomann.&nbsp; He calmed
his agitation&mdash;arose from her feet, and spoke kindly and
steadily to tranquillise hers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not hate me,
beautiful sovereign of my destiny,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that
thus I am compelled to add to your inquietudes.&nbsp; Yet be not
alarmed needlessly; I adore you, but no force shall be put upon
your inclinations: forgive me, if, impelled by a power I dare not
disobey, I am sometimes obliged to give you pain by this
question.&nbsp; But fear not&mdash;my wishes shall be sacrificed
to yours&mdash;I would not receive that hand, dear as it would
be, unless voluntarily presented by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess took courage at this declaration of her hideous
lover.&nbsp; She knew he was a monster of his word; and she
thought if he would not receive her hand till she presented it,
she should be safe from the infliction of such a husband.&nbsp;
Assuring him, therefore, that she was far from hating him, and
expressing with warmth the sentiments she really felt for her
grim admirer, the poor monster was somewhat comforted, which
Ildegarda was not sorry to remark; for if Brandomann was ugly
when he was gay, he was ten thousand times more so when in
sorrow.&nbsp; They returned to the palace in tolerable spirits,
and in <a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>the evening Ildegarda took an opportunity of depositing
her perplexities in the bosom of the respectable white goat, for
whom she began to experience something of filial affection.&nbsp;
Heidruna consoled the princess by her unqualified praises of the
honour and sincerity of Brandomann, and her firm conviction that
Ildegarda would never be molested by his fondness; although
Heidruna thought, and could not help telling her young friend,
that in the world she might have matched herself with many a
greater beast than Brandomann: but, as this was entirely a matter
of opinion, she rather soothed the princess than contradicted
her.&nbsp; The good Serimnor interrupted the
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, and fully seconded the
opinion of Heidruna, both as to the honour and goodness of the
lord monster of Moskoe.&nbsp; &ldquo;You observe,&rdquo; said he
to Ildegarda, &ldquo;that he has been admitted among the
Scaldres, an order which generally requires perfection from its
aspirants; and great must his virtues be, when the unbounded
ugliness of his person could not outweigh them, nor conceal the
richness and beauty of his mind.&nbsp; He is also, as we are, the
descendant of Odin, and peculiarly favoured by the mightiest of
the gods, and his son Thor, the thunderbolt: he enjoys extensive
power, and many prerogatives <a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>not granted to the more beautiful
children of nature, to compensate for the imprisonment of such a
spirit in so hideous and detestable a frame.&nbsp; Were it
possible to overcome your natural repugnance, you would have no
reason to regret the change; but should your aversion be
invincible, you will have nothing to fear, since he will continue
to you the tenderest and humblest of lovers, and we shall always
remain your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess thanked the friendly boar for his kind assurance,
and they separated for the night in increased good will towards
each other.&nbsp; In a few days after this conversation,
Brandomann sought the princess in her chamber.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
storm is gathering above the whirlpool,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;its effects will be terrific&mdash;our friends are
collected to watch its progress&mdash;shall we follow them to the
coast?&nbsp; If it will interest you, I will raise my magic tent
upon the top of the highest rock, and, sheltered even from the
slightest drops of rain, you shall see the storm in its terrors,
and the fiends unseen of mortal eyes, who increase its horrors
and sport in its bosom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda accepted the
invitation, and the rein-deer swiftly bore their light and lovely
burthen to the rocks, accompanied by Brandomann, whose
eight-legged steed would far have outstripped the nimble <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>coursers of
the princess, but for the frequent checks of his rider.&nbsp;
Arrived at the point of rock, they beheld the waters raging
around them, (for the island was seated in the midst of the
gulf,) but with less violence than Ildegarda had expected: she
remarked this to her attendant.&nbsp; &ldquo;The waters are now
at their height,&rdquo; replied Brandomann; &ldquo;and for one
quarter of an hour it will be tolerably calm, but the power of
the storm will be tremendous when that short interval shall be
past: many, deceived by the calm, venture out while it lasts, and
encounter certain destruction at its close.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ildegarda continued watching for the termination of the delusive
calm, when her meditations were interrupted by the arrival of
Heidruna, Serimnor, and the ravens: they arranged themselves
round the chariot of the princess, and, protected from the storm
by the magic tent of Brandomann, stood watching its progress in
silent anxiety.&nbsp; The deceitful calm, as the lord of the
island had predicted, was of no long duration.&nbsp; In a few
minutes the brightness of Balder was entirely obscured; the wind
chorus began, and swept low and sullenly over the waters, which
now rose upwards, gently murmuring, as if they were the echoes of
the distant song.&nbsp; &ldquo;Listen, Ildegarda,&rdquo; said
Brandomann; <a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>&ldquo;to you it is given to hear the secrets and
wonders of the earth, in recompense for being thus shut out from
its more social intercourse: listen, and you will hear the
unknown song of the winds: hark! how it rises from an
immeasurable distance, and yet you can distinguish their voices,
and the words they utter.&nbsp; Now they come
nearer&mdash;hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">THE SONG OF THE
WINDS.</p>
<p class="poetry">From the couch of the billows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hollow bed<br />
Where ocean pillows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His giant head&mdash;<br />
From secret caves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where ancient Night<br />
Sleeps secure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From staring light&mdash;<br />
From the breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the trembling earth,<br />
Scorning rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We have our birth.<br />
Up, up, upward, murmuring,<br />
Up, up, upward, still go we.</p>
<p class="poetry">From wild Hecla&rsquo;s burning cells,<br />
Where the giant mother dwells,<br />
Who to Lok, in days of yore,<br />
Sin and death and horror bore&mdash;<br />
<a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>From the
Geyser&rsquo;s boiling springs,<br />
We soar, upborne on rushing wings,<br />
Singing louder as we go,<br />
Blow, ye wild winds, louder blow!</p>
<p class="poetry">Up from the Dolstein still rise we,<br />
Where about us rolled the sea,<br />
And beneath, for ever whirled,<br />
The master spirit of the world&mdash;<br />
From the raging Dofrefeld,<br />
Where green Niord&rsquo;s feast is held&mdash;<br />
From the land of eternal snow,<br />
Blow, ye wild winds, louder blow!</p>
<p class="poetry">We come, we come! the forests wave,<br />
As above their tops we rave.<br />
Blow winds, blow! the crashing tree<br />

And the crash of falling towers,<br />
Speak our presence, and our powers.<br />
Blow winds, blow! to heaven ascending,<br />
Clashing, crashing, crushing, rending,<br />
Wrath on earth and ocean pouring,<br />
O&rsquo;er the scared world, raging, roaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The storm is indeed terrific now,&rdquo; said
Ildegarda; &ldquo;I can almost see it in the air, as it scatters
the clouds before it: look how the waters rise to meet it,
roaring with the fury and force <a name="page303"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 303</span>of a cataract!&rdquo;&nbsp; Amid the
uproar, she thought she distinguished other noises than those of
the tempest&mdash;a sound like the howls and shrieks of pain: she
noticed the circumstance to Brandomann.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
right,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;look yonder, where a desperate
battle is waging, in despite of this scene of tempest.&nbsp; A
bear has swum from his mountain territory of Hilseggen to prey
upon the flocks of Suarven, one of the few islands in this gulf
which is inhabited; a single gallant shepherd has attacked him,
but I fear the bear has the mastery: see! the shepherd has lost
his staff, and the monster grapples with him closely&mdash;he
hugs him fiercely!&mdash;Is there no way by which I can save
him?&nbsp; What, ho! shepherd!&mdash;what, ho!&mdash;loosen
yourself from the grasp of your enemy and fly&mdash;stand on the
very edge of the rock, and let him spring against you!&mdash;So,
so&mdash;the fellow fears me no less than the bear, yet he
obeys&mdash;he is crouching&mdash;his enemy
runs&mdash;plunges&mdash;ah! ah!&mdash;he has lost his balance
and dashes headlong into the stream&mdash;well, run,
shepherd!&mdash;He stays not to sing the death-song for his
foe.&mdash;Good night, friend bear, you will sup with the fish of
the Maelstrom to-night!&rdquo;&nbsp; While they looked on, they
beheld the savage animal struggling for his life against the
dreadful current, <a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>but in vain; borne onward, despite of his roarings, he
was soon over the terrible pool, and then whirled rapidly round,
till he was sucked down into the bosom of the dismal gulf, which,
sages have written, penetrates the globe.&nbsp; Ildegarda pitied
the poor bear, whose love of mutton had occasioned him so
miserable a fate; but a new wonder now claimed her attention and
diverted her thoughts from his sorrows: this was another island,
slowly arising from the bottom of the lake, and covered with
sea-weeds, becoming stationary at no great distance from
Moskoe.&nbsp; Before Ildegarda could point it out to her
companions, Serimnor advanced hastily towards Brandomann.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is mischief abroad, dear brother,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;this storm is not of Niord&rsquo;s raising.&nbsp; Some
friend beloved of Odin, and abhorred of Lok, is certainly in
danger; for look who are sporting in the tempest.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
pointed to the bosom of the gulf and to the rocky shore of
Otterholm.&nbsp; In the centre of the one, Ildegarda beheld the
head of a monstrous serpent reared above the waves, and surveying
with fiery eyes the distant sea; and on the other a hideous wolf,
with his attention fixed in the same direction, and howling in
concert with the storm.&nbsp; The princess shuddered, and, for
the first time in her life, drew <a name="page305"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 305</span>nearer to Brandomann for
protection.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have nothing to fear,
dearest,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;from these monsters whom you
behold; they are indeed your foes and mine, for they are the
children of Lok, and the enemies of Odin; but they have no power
over you, and mine, by the gift of their conqueror, is greater
than their own.&nbsp; He whom you see in the waters is the giant
snake, whose folds of sin encircle the guilty earth, and who now,
from its centre, is bidding defiance to some noble foe of his
evil father.&nbsp; Fenris the wolf-dog, guard of hell, appears
only when mischief is in the air, to increase, by his cries and
the horror of his form, the fears and the danger of his
victim.&nbsp; I deem some hapless vessel has approached too near
this coast during the calm, and now the storm will drag it to
destruction.&nbsp; But let us watch&mdash;Hugo and Mumin, stretch
out your pinions&mdash;fly over the waters, and tell me what you
descry.&rdquo;&nbsp; The messengers of Odin obeyed&mdash;they
flew over the bosom of the lake&mdash;then out towards the
boundless and ungirt ocean: suddenly they returned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A sail! a sail!&rdquo; said Hugo.&nbsp; &ldquo;A gallant
ship!&rdquo; cried Mumin; &ldquo;the whirl has surely caught her,
she comes on so rapidly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon, very soon, she
neared, and drove onwards, visible to all.&nbsp; Brandomann
grasped <a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>his club: &ldquo;Some bold adventurers,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;doubtless, who seek to land upon this island in defiance
of the will of Odin; if so, they are lost indeed, for the king of
Valhalla has resigned them to the power of the
infernals.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was frightful to mark the force with
which the ship drove on.&nbsp; &ldquo;They make for the island
which has just risen from the lake,&rdquo; said the
princess.&nbsp; &ldquo;Death will too surely greet them
there,&rdquo; replied Brandomann; &ldquo;for that is no land, but
the snare of fiends to beguile; it is the dreadful Kraken, that
monster of the deep, who, when the vessel touches him, will sink,
and draw it with him&rdquo;&mdash;And the vessel was near the
monster, when a piercing shriek from Ildegarda arrested the
thoughts of Brandomann.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is my father!&rdquo; she
cried&mdash;&ldquo;it is my father!&mdash;I know his
banner&mdash;he seeks me on this island&mdash;have mercy,
Odin!&mdash;Oh, Brandomann, if thou lovest
me&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;If I love thee!&mdash;lo! now I disobey
the will of Odin for thee!&mdash;judge, then, how dear thou
art!&rdquo;&nbsp; He started from her side, sprung upon Sleipner,
darted from the rock, and the next instant Ildegarda beheld his
giant form stemming the torrent with a power equal to its
own.&nbsp; The wolf beheld him and ran howling away, while a
single blow from his mighty club drove the grim serpent <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>beneath the
waves, to howl his disappointment in Niftheim.&nbsp; Ildegarda
heard none of the consoling speeches addressed to her by her
friends; her ear&mdash;her eye&mdash;her heart, were all with
Brandomann: she shrieked aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will not reach it
ere it touches the Kraken,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and then all
help will be in vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so, dear
princess,&rdquo; replied Serimnor; &ldquo;he acts with the power
of Odin, and will save your father; and then what will not his
generosity deserve?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My life&mdash;my
love!&rdquo; distractedly replied the wretched Ildegarda, totally
incapable of accepting any consolation, and only alive to the
danger of her father.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Odin! save him!&rdquo; she
cried; &ldquo;and thou, thou the nameless!&mdash;the mighty in
strength&mdash;the blind invincible&mdash;preserve the faithful
Brandomann!&rdquo;&nbsp; At this instant the Kraken
sunk&mdash;the hoof of Sleipner had touched him&mdash;and
Brandomann sternly approached the vessel: a band of warriors,
headed by her father, prepared to oppose him, and Ildegarda
beheld their bright weapons gleaming above his head.&nbsp; At
this sight, &ldquo;Harm him not,&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;ye
know not whom ye strike!&rdquo;&nbsp; But the next instant shewed
her the folly of her fear and the mighty power of her
lover.&nbsp; Heedless of the flashing swords, Sleipner sprung
among the <a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>warriors, whose arms were now useless in their deadened
hands, and Brandomann stood upon the deck, sternly reproving
their presumption, and commanding the gallant ship to return home
to Denmark.&nbsp; The vessel obeyed&mdash;the warriors knew the
eight-legged steed of Odin, and were silent; but Haquin accused
aloud the murderer of his daughter, for he judged he beheld the
lord of the Maelstrom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy daughter lives,&rdquo;
replied the terrible Brandomann; &ldquo;but she is mine: at her
entreaty I have saved thy forfeit life&mdash;but approach no more
the island forbidden by Odin to mortal foot, else will I resign
thee to the fate thy presumption will incur, and which, but for
thy daughter&rsquo;s tears, thou wouldest ere now have
tasted.&nbsp; Hence, Haquin, and learn submission!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sleipner plunged into the waters, and the vessel, now removed
beyond the power of the whirlpool, sailed back to Denmark, while
Brandomann returned to Ildegarda, by whom he was received with a
welcome far surpassing his hopes or expectations.&nbsp; He said
nothing, however, of the important service he had just rendered
her; and this delicate conduct, which did not pass unobserved by
the princess, created for him an advocate in her bosom stronger
than his own entreaties, or those of all his friends united,
could <a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>have done.&nbsp; She saw how tenderly Brandomann loved
her, but she saw also that he was resolved not to give her pain;
and, to say the truth, she could not help being pleased by this
circumstance: for her gratitude, great as it certainly was, was
yet not sufficiently powerful to make so cruel a sacrifice to his
happiness.&nbsp; By the time he had landed, the storm had passed
from the face of heaven, and all was as calm upon the bosom of
the waters as if the fiends of Niftheim had not been raging
within it but a few moments before; the party returned to sup in
the palace, and all things went on as pleasingly as usual.&nbsp;
Days, weeks, passed away, but Ildegarda, no longer wretched in
submitting to the sentence she had once thought so cruel, took
little heed of time, except to notice the first day of the month,
which presented to her anxious eyes the person and occupations of
her father.&nbsp; Twice, successively, she had seen him in his
tent, surrounded by heroes, amid preparations for war; he was
cheerful, and appeared to be encouraging the spirits of a young
man, whom Ildegarda knew to be prince Harold, and who, with a
gentle, downcast look, was listening to his observations: this
was confirmed to her by the accounts of Brandomann, whose cares
to lighten her anxieties and anticipate her <a
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>wishes
sensibly affected the generous daughter of Haquin.&nbsp; She took
increased delight in his conversation; and he, from whose
presence she was at first so anxious to fly, was now frequently
summoned to relieve solitude by his cheering conversation.&nbsp;
She was herself surprised at the change; and could she have shut
from her bosom the thought of her early and beautiful love,
Brandomann, even in person, would not have been disgusting.&nbsp;
As it was, he daily grew less odious, and daily grew the princess
more contented with her lot; the happy society of the marble
palace met nightly, and mirth, and song, and tale, gave wings to
the cheerful hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> night when the conversation
particularly turned upon the exploits of the ancestors of
Ildegarda, Sleipner, who possessed a natural love of noble
actions, inquired of the boar whether king Uffon was constant in
his attendance upon the nightly festival of the hall of
Odin?&nbsp; &ldquo;He is so, frequently,&rdquo; replied Serimnor;
&ldquo;but he takes more delight in the combat of the
morning&mdash;from that he is never absent:&mdash;but what an
extraordinary history is his!&rdquo; continued the boar;
&ldquo;it is necessary that he should be in Asgard, for its
inhabitants to believe it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda&rsquo;s
attention was aroused; she had never heard of her ancestor, and
she entreated Brandomann to indulge her curiosity.&nbsp; He took
up his harp <a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>immediately&mdash;for he appeared to have no occupation
so delightful as to obey her slightest wish&mdash;and thus
related to her the legend of Uffon the Merciful:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">LEGEND OF UFFON.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I.</p>
<p>There was a halo round<br />
The golden crown which shone on Vermund&rsquo;s brow,<br />
The light of many noble deeds&mdash;<br />
Some deathless flowers<br />
From heaven&rsquo;s immortal tree,<br />
(The abode of changeless destiny,)<br />
Were wreathed<br />
Around his conquering sword:<br />
But years rolled on, and age<br />
Silvered his golden locks&mdash;<br />
And then a darkness fell<br />
Heavily on him,<br />
Veiling the beauty of his later day&mdash;<br />
For Lok in hate,<br />
Or envy, breathed on him a withering curse&mdash;<br />
And he grew blind!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">II.</p>
<p>He was a childless man,<br />
And to the gods he prayed<br />
That his own royal diadem might fall<br />
Upon a kindred brow.<br />
He asked a son&mdash;<br />
And Odin granted to his agony<br />
The son he craved.<br />
<a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>Again
the evil one<br />
Blighted the bud of joy&mdash;<br />
He laid his dark hand on the infant&rsquo;s head,<br />
And left its evil shadow on his brain&mdash;<br />
He grew an idiot boy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">III.</p>
<p>The Saxon king,<br />
A wild, fierce warrior, heard of Vermund&rsquo;s grief,<br />
And he did rage to snatch, with greedy hand,<br />
The sceptre of the blind.<br />
Madly he poured<br />
His thousands o&rsquo;er the land;<br />
The red steel clashed&mdash;<br />
The curling fire ran&mdash;<br />
The ravens fed<br />
On beauty, and the eagles gorged on strength.<br />
The blind prince trembling heard<br />
His people&rsquo;s dying groan!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">IV.</p>
<p>The Saxon king<br />
Rode, like the thunderbolt, his mighty steed<br />
To the sad Danish camp.<br />
He mocked the king&mdash;<br />
And to his peers, with haughty action, said,<br />
&ldquo;Doth it become<br />
The noble sons of Odin thus to bend<br />
The knee before a blind man, and a fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">V.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out on thee, wretch!&rdquo;<br />
The sightless prince exclaimed;<br />
<a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>&ldquo;It more becomes the warrior to protect<br />
Than scorn the weak and aged!&mdash;<br />
Mighty!&mdash;to thee&mdash;<br />
Thee! whom we fear to name&mdash;<br />
Thee! strongest pillar of great Odin&rsquo;s throne&mdash;<br />
Thee! dark, but terrible!&mdash;whose woe I bear&mdash;<br />
Thee! whose most awful name<br />
The reckless echo dares not repeat, and we<br />
Shudder as we pronounce!<br />
HODER!&mdash;I call on thee!&mdash;<br />
Be thou the judge<br />
Between this wretch and me!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">VI.</p>
<p>The Saxon heard<br />
And shrunk at that dread name&mdash;<br />
The nobles groaned&mdash;<br />
The father wept, and clasped,<br />
To his chilled heart, his dumb and idiot boy.<br />
When, lo! a wonder!&mdash;<br />
His sacred tears fell on the youthful brow<br />
Like holy rain upon the scorched up earth,<br />
And upward to the sun of glory sprung<br />
The buried seeds of intellect&mdash;<br />
He spoke!&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">VII.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! scoffer!&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;didst thou not
know<br />
The blind and weak are sacred?&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
His eye shone<br />
With a miraculous light&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Hark!&nbsp; Saxon churl!<br />
I summon thee unto the field of death&mdash;<br />
<a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

there,<br />
And on thy craven bosom write a truth,<br />
That Vermund hath a son&mdash;Denmark a prince,<br />
Who <i>will</i> protect their glories!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">VIII.</p>
<p>The day came&mdash;<br />
And Uffon&rsquo;s fiery chariot bore him forth<br />
Unto the battle field&mdash;<br />
Less bright&mdash;less beautiful<br />
Is Balder when, from Lidscialf&rsquo;s diamond steps,<br />
He rises to illuminate the worlds<br />
Which wheel caressingly around him&mdash;and<br />
Gallantly rode the Saxon.<br />
But the king&mdash;<br />
The blind&mdash;the father&mdash;where is he?&nbsp; He sits<br />
On yonder rock, high o&rsquo;er the foaming sea,<br />
There to await the battle.<br />
Should <i>he</i> fall&mdash;<br />
His own&mdash;his only one&mdash;<br />
Ocean will catch his form,<br />
And hide his griefs for ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">IX.</p>
<p>It was a deadly fight<br />
Between the Saxon and the Dane;<br />
And once<br />
There was a scream, as if the inspired boy<br />
Was lost, for he had sunk upon his knee&mdash;<br />
But he beheld his father&rsquo;s sightless eye<br />
Upturned in agony&mdash;<br />
And he arose&mdash;and then<br />
<a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>Another
sound was heard&mdash;a mighty shout&mdash;<br />
The scorner of the blind was slain!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">X.</p>
<p>The son&mdash;he flew,<br />
A bounding reindeer, to his father&rsquo;s arms&mdash;<br />
He paused&mdash;<br />
<i>They</i> were upraised,<br />
In attitude of thankfulness;<br />
His lips<br />
Were pale, and still, and smiling&mdash;<br />
But&mdash;his heart<br />
Had broke in that fierce struggle&mdash;<br />
He was gone&mdash;<br />
Heimdaller&rsquo;s wings were shadowing him, as o&rsquo;er<br />
The wondrous bridge he trod;<br />
Valkyries bore<br />
His spirit to the foot of Odin&rsquo;s throne,<br />
To tell of Uffon&rsquo;s glory.</p>

This justice was thy deed&mdash;<br />
We worship thee,<br />
Although we love thee not!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No, truly,&rdquo; said Serimnor, on the conclusion of
the legend; &ldquo;that would be quite impossible either for
heaven or earth: but glory to the good Uffon&mdash;few warriors
in Valhalla are more esteemed than he.&nbsp; The skull of the
impious Saxon is now his drinking cup; and his father, restored
<a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>to
sight, beholds the pledge of victory with undying felicity: and,
in the combats and martial sports of the morning, the battle
between his noble son and the Saxon is daily renewed, to gladden
him with the sound of conquest and triumph over his shadowy
foe.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Look, Serimnor,&rdquo; said the horse of
Odin, interrupting him impatiently, as a bright flash of
lightning darted into the hall and played against his head for a
moment; &ldquo;Look, we are again outstaying our time&mdash;the
son of Rinda is shooting his brilliant arrows, and one has
already touched you: let us obey the summons, and not provoke him
to make his fatal shafts unerring.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Away,
then!&rdquo; cried Heidruna.&nbsp; The ravens flapped their
wings&mdash;Brandomann rose&mdash;and the hall was cleared in a
moment.</p>
<p>Ildegarda had hitherto been happy in the reports of the magic
mirror, and satisfied with its assurances of her father&rsquo;s
safety.&nbsp; On the first of the tenth month of her residence on
the island, she again withdrew the curtain,&mdash;but a different
spectacle awaited her; Haquin was lying wounded upon his couch,
pale and insensible, while his attendants were anxiously
endeavouring to stanch the blood which flowed from his injured
side.&nbsp; The princess became wild with apprehension; <a
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>instantly
she sought her faithful Brandomann, to pour into his bosom the
grief which distracted hers.&nbsp; He listened with tender
sympathy.&nbsp; &ldquo;There has been a battle between your
father and Frotho, no doubt,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but though
I am not informed of all the particulars, I know that Haquin will
not die of this wound: take comfort from this assurance, for when
did I ever deceive you?&rdquo;&nbsp; But Ildegarda refused all
consolation, and persisted in thinking and making herself the
most miserable of all human beings.&nbsp; Her father was
ill&mdash;wounded&mdash;in need of her assistance&mdash;and she
herself uncertain of his fate for a whole month at least.&nbsp;
Her anxiety hourly increased, and her grief, too powerful to be
concealed from Brandomann, affected him no less painfully than
herself.&nbsp; It was in vain he exerted his talents to divert
her anguish; she was grateful for his kindness, but did not shed
one tear the less: his conversation had lost its charms, his
tales and songs their interest.&nbsp; Brandomann discovered this,
and, after a terrible struggle, his generous nature overmastered
every selfish and interested feeling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
cannot,&rdquo; said he at length to the weeping princess;
&ldquo;I cannot bear to witness your sorrow, and know that I am
the cause.&nbsp; For your sake I will again disobey <a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>the command
of Odin, which had decreed your captivity to be perpetual; you
shall go to your father: promise me that you will return hither,
and you shall be swiftly conveyed to his tent&mdash;and remain
with him seven days; at the close of that period you must return,
or my life will pay the forfeit of my fault, and be demanded to
appease the anger of Odin.&nbsp; Go, then, beloved
princess,&mdash;but sometimes think of Brandomann, and what he
will suffer for your sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; The princess could
scarcely believe what she heard: in a rapture of joy she accepted
the offer, and was most fervent in her promises to return at the
expiration of the seven days.&nbsp; Brandomann sighed heavily,
but made no reply to her frequent protestations of their soon
meeting again.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall be with your father
to-morrow morning,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;merely take this
ring&mdash;put it upon your finger when you go to rest to-night,
and do the same thing when you wish to return to me; but do not
wear it at any other time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The princess joyfully
accepted the gift&mdash;took an affectionate leave of her admired
monster&mdash;and retired to rest full of hope and
expectation&mdash;expectations which were fully realised on her
awaking in the morning; for she found her couch <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>in her
father&rsquo;s tent, and he himself gazing upon her with tender
anxiety and wonder.</p>
<p>The joy of Haquin, at again folding his beloved child to his
bosom, was considerably damped by the narrative of her
adventures, and the promise which she had given to Brandomann to
return.&nbsp; As he did not deem it possible that she intended to
keep her word, he was not a little astonished at her declaration,
when she assured him she could remain with him only during the
seven days.&nbsp; He argued strongly against her intention; and
she at present, unwilling to distress him, ceased to oppose his
opinions, and occupied herself entirely with the care of his
health, knowing that it would always be in her power to return
whenever she felt the inclination.&nbsp; Her tender attention was
fully appreciated by Haquin, but she herself was far from being
at ease in the midst of a tumultuous camp, where her wishes were
not anticipated with the swift and delighted obedience of her
island attendants: she had no change of dress either; a
circumstance peculiarly vexatious, as she was daily surrounded by
admiring warriors, who constantly paid homage to her
charms,&mdash;and among whom prince Harold was not the least
fervent in his expressions of devotion <a
name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>to her
beauty.&nbsp; Awakening one morning after many regrets upon this
subject to herself overnight, she was surprised to see the chest
which ornamented her chamber at Moskoe, and which contained her
superb wardrobe, standing by the side of her couch: she opened it
hastily: &ldquo;Kind, generous Brandomann, always alike
solicitous for my happiness and pleasure,&rdquo; she exclaimed;
&ldquo;how much do I not owe thee!&rdquo;&nbsp; She immediately
decorated her lovely person and returned to her father, who,
cheered by her presence and renovated by her care, was quickly
recovering from the effects of his wound: he now informed her
that Haldane was universally said to have been murdered by his
uncle; and that, in consequence of their disgust at this act of
cruelty, many noble Danes had resorted to the standard of Harold,
whom they had unanimously called to the throne, though they held
not the gentle boy in the same estimation as his more valiant
brother.&nbsp; To this he added, that as the young king had
declared a passion for Ildegarda, he had determined to unite them
despite of the wrath of Frotho, and thus repay her long captivity
by placing her upon a throne.&nbsp; His daughter had many
objections to this arrangement, but her father&rsquo;s heart
appeared to joy so deeply in its <a name="page322"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 322</span>contemplation that Ildegarda had not
the courage to undeceive him: the tenderness of Haquin, the
novelty of again seeing human faces, and the pleasure of
listening to the gallant praises of the noble Danes, at length
rendered Ildegarda forgetful of her promise, and not only seven
days, but twice that number slipped away, ere she called to mind
the probable anxiety of Brandomann.&nbsp; She now determined to
repair her fault and hasten back to the island, but when, upon
retiring to rest, she sought her ring to place it upon her
finger, the talisman was no where to be found.&nbsp; In great
distress she hastened to her father, expecting him perhaps to
sympathise in her misfortune, but, unlike the gentle monster of
the Maelstrom, he laughed at her anxiety, and congratulated her
upon her loss; he bade her be under no apprehension respecting
her ring, since it was safe in his possession&mdash;he had stolen
it on being informed of its virtue, in order to secure her
company,&mdash;&ldquo;which,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it
appears, without this precaution I should have lost.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He observed that he could not permit such a preposterous union
between beauty and a beast, who, instead of being a descendant of
Odin, was doubtless a member of the infernal royal family of Lok,
and consequently some <a name="page323"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 323</span>diabolical sorcerer, who had thus
bought her, body and soul, of Frotho: he would give her, he
remarked, a husband better suited to her rank and beauty, and
commanded her to prepare to espouse her royal cousin Harold,
within at least ten days.&nbsp; Ildegarda was much startled by
this conversation; and she who in the desolate island had mourned
over the idea of perpetual captivity, now wept with more
bitterness her recovered liberty, and the prospect of never more
returning to her prison; she thought of the tender obedience of
Brandomann to her lightest wish, and his generous self-denial
upon all occasions respecting her.&nbsp; She lamented the
kind-hearted Serimnor, the chivalrous horse, the affectionate
goat, and even the ravens and rein-deer received the tribute of
her tears; but the idea of the probable suffering of Brandomann
for his devotion to her, and disobedience in her favour, filled
her heart with the most poignant regret; she hated Harold, and
she esteemed her Maelstrom friend, and not a day passed without
the severest search for the ring that was to convey her back to
his territories.&nbsp; At length Rinda, in pity, heard her
prayers.&nbsp; In her father&rsquo;s bosom, during his sleep, she
found her glittering ring, which she hastily secured as her
dearest treasure, and instantly retired to rest; <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>and when
morning again looked upon her, it was in her chamber of the
desolate isle.</p>
<p>Ildegarda scarce waited fully to throw off the fetters of
sleep ere she descended to the marble hall, and instantly gave
the signal which used to summon Brandomann to her presence, and
which he had never neglected; now it was unheeded.&nbsp; Alarmed,
she repeated it more strongly&mdash;Brandomann replied not to the
call; half-distracted she hurried through the palace, and
harrowed her own feelings by recalling to mind his mournful
prediction of the fate which awaited him, should she exceed her
allotted time.&nbsp; She shuddered to reflect how long that time
had elapsed.&nbsp; From the palace she traversed the gardens,
running wildly with an aching heart and burning brow to every
quarter, and asking every object she met for tidings of her
lamented Brandomann: the birds and the echoes alone replied to
her mournful queries, and disconsolate and despairing she threw
herself upon the sod to give vent to the bitterness of her
sorrow, and lament undisturbed her affliction.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Brandomann!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;Brandomann! where
art thou? friend of my soul, art thou yet in existence, or hath
my ingratitude destroyed thee?&nbsp; Oh, if thou hearest, if thou
beholdest these tears, have pity on thy <a
name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>wretched
Ildegarda, and hasten to relieve her agony, and pardon her
involuntary crime.&rdquo;&nbsp; She started up in a sudden
ecstasy, for a low groan at no great distance from her seemed to
be an answer to her question; she rushed forward in that
direction, and soon beheld the hapless Brandomann stretched upon
the earth, and apparently in the agonies of death; but her
beloved voice, the touch of her gentle hand, the glance of her
worshipped eye, either of these would have recalled him to life,
and now all were lavishly employed to restore him: he looked up
for a moment.&nbsp; Mournfully he said, &ldquo;Beloved, thou art
come to see me die!&rdquo; and then relapsed into stupor and
forgetfulness.&nbsp; Ildegarda wept in agony&mdash;she was
hanging over him in listless sorrow, when her thoughts were
aroused by the appearance of Heidruna.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brandomann is
dying,&rdquo; said the white goat, &ldquo;and from grief at your
neglect; but you have returned, and, in compassion to your
sufferings, I am permitted to restore him to you: take the bowl
you see yonder, draw forth a portion of my milk, and give it to
his lips; the hydromel of heaven will call him back to
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda obeyed&mdash;she gave the miraculous
draught to Brandomann, who as instantly recovered his reason and
his strength; <a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
326</span>with tears of joy she expressed her gratitude to
Heidruna; and the Moskoe chief observing her delight, and too
happy once more to behold her, readily forgave her all he had
suffered in her absence.&nbsp; There was much happiness that
night in the marble palace; Sleipner bowed down his arched neck
to receive a pat from her snowy hand; Serimnor grinned till his
huge tusks were completely visible; the ravens presented her the
tips of their wings, and flew screaming about, as if <i>they</i>
had been drinking the hydromel of Valhalla.&nbsp; Ildegarda was
happy, and Brandomann dared not trust his feelings to
words.&nbsp; Sunny walks and moonlight musings were now the
pursuits of the imprisoned pair; for instead of retiring to rest,
as formerly, when the Valhalla people went to their party, they
roamed over the island, contemplating the stars, and talking
tenderly of course, for when were love and moonshine
separated?&nbsp; It is true, in this instance, the tenderness was
all on one side; for though Ildegarda permitted it, since she saw
the happiness it gave to Brandomann, she yet could not prevail
upon herself to return it, or say the words he wished to hear
from her lips.&nbsp; One evening, as thus, in the tranquil
moonlight, they sat alone in the summery isle, Ildegarda was
astonished, by <a name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
327</span>the appearance of a wonder she had never yet remarked
in the island; the moon was suddenly eclipsed by a light so
glorious, yet so soft, that every object around her was visible
in the brightness of beaming gold, yet without giving pain to the
sense.&nbsp; Brandomann remarked her admiration.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This beauteous light,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a mark of
the approbation of the father of the gods, at some virtuous
action of a favourite of heaven; it is Odin&rsquo;s fire, dear
Ildegarda, the light of his glorious smile; and shining now as it
does upon thee, and our lonely isle, it comes to tell thee he is
satisfied with thy past conduct, and approves thy
present.&rdquo;&nbsp; Scarcely was this explanation given, ere
the beauteous light died away from the mountains and the palace,
and night wore again her solemn robe of darkness.&nbsp; As they
prepared to return, the star-studded sky, the jewel-paved floor
of the palaces of Asgard, sparkling with its unnumbered lights,
and shining in its soft blue glory, struck on their souls with
delight; and, while they were gazing in rapture, a large and
brilliant star shot from its place in the heaven and vanished
rapidly from their sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some noble warrior or
virtuous sage has closed his eyes upon this mortal scene,&rdquo;
said Brandomann, tenderly: &ldquo;that was the star of his <a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>destiny; it
fell from its seat in the heaven when he quitted his on the
earth: this is the sign that tells to the survivors his fate, if
it is fulfilled in the night; by day it is the vision of the
rainbow bridge, the sacred arch that connects this earth with
heaven, and over which the spirits of the just must
pass.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have heard that it is only visible to
mortal sight, when the peculiarly brave and virtuous ascend its
brilliant road,&rdquo; said Ildegarda.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you have
heard aright, dearest,&rdquo; replied Brandomann; &ldquo;it is
only then that the guardian spirit of the bridge, Heimdaller of
the radiant brow, descends from his abode on its top to meet and
welcome the traveller; then it is, that the light from his
rushing wings, and the gems which compose his jewelled crown,
shine so strongly on the arch, as to render it visible to mortal
sight, clad in the reflected glories of its guardian&rsquo;s
diadem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morrow Brandomann relieved her anxiety, which had been
awakened by the sight of the falling star, lest her
father&rsquo;s should no more have a seat in the heavens, nor
himself a name on the earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;A mild and gracious
being hath left us,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for the happier scenes
of Asgard; Sevald is dead&mdash;the virtuous son of the abandoned
Frotho is no more&mdash;he fell, as became his <a
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>race, in
the battle-field, contending against your victorious father and
his kinsman Harold, against whom the tyrant rages and vows
destruction, as now the only rival he has to fear.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The princess was satisfied by this explanation, the more
especially as the first day of the month again presented the
person of her father, though surrounded by the bustle of war.</p>

inspiration flows, deserves the best, ay, and first fruits of
your genius!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It was only because I feared my
feeble strains would not do justice to the lofty subject,&rdquo;
replied Brandomann; &ldquo;the glory of the father of gods and
men requires a mightier hand than mine to celebrate it; Brage
alone should strike the golden chord to his honour&mdash;alone
should sing of deeds beyond the feeble thought of <a
name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>mortality;
that which I can, I will; I dare not wake the voice of song, but
I will speak of his wondrous deeds, that to-night, in Valhalla,
thou mayest tell bright Asgard&rsquo;s king that I have
instructed this lovely maiden what honours and love are due to
the first of her race, and the friend of her father.&nbsp; Will
it please thee, Ildegarda, to listen to the legend of
Sigge?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Beyond all other things,&rdquo;
replied the princess, pleasedly: and Brandomann, smiling,
began&mdash;</p>
<h4>The Legend of Sigge.</h4>
<p>From his high and everlasting throne in Valhalla, had Odin,
the dispenser of good, poured forth, with unsparing hand,
innumerable benefits upon his attendant spirits.&nbsp; In the
burning benevolence of his heart he forgot, or he disregarded,
that to some essences obligation is pain, and gratitude a toil;
so high did he raise some of those bright creations that stood
nearest to his throne, that they became too great for obedience,
and impatient of the most gentle restraint.&nbsp; Lok, the most
glorious of these glorious things, seated on the lowest step of
the throne of light, saw but one between him and the highest; and
once on that, what should restrain him from the throne of <a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>the
universe?&nbsp; Thus he thought, and thus he did: by his
eloquence he seduced the higher spirits from their duty&mdash;by
his beauty and promises the lower.&nbsp; The worlds of Asgard
sent their governing spirits forth to fight under his banner, and
Surter brought myriads to his side.&nbsp; For the first time
since the creation, the standards of revolt flew in the cities of
Asgard, and the proud Lok drove back, with contempt, the
interceding ministers of Odin, who came to remonstrate upon his
madness.&nbsp; Confident in his power, the giant spirit entered
Valasciolf, the city of the king, and dared even advance to
Valhalla: the immortal beings who surround the diamond throne
shuddered at his presumption, and, veiling their bright heads
from the terrible glances of Odin, wept the approaching destiny
of companions once so beloved, which they read in the eye of
their master: the sovereign of the universe gave no command to
his people&mdash;he uttered no reproach&mdash;he suffered his
faithful spirits to fly before the sword of Lok and the devouring
fires of Surter&mdash;he even permitted the lost ones to approach
the steps of his eternal throne&mdash;then, when with proud
exultation they advanced to seize upon him whose power they
believed departed, he calmly arose from his seat and stretched
out his right hand, armed with its <a name="page333"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 333</span>invincible falchion, towards his
enemies; at that tremendous signal Niord let loose the oceans of
heaven, and, in terrific grandeur, they came rolling down upon
the revolted; the winds from all the worlds were summoned up to
heaven to aid their master, and rend and scatter his
offenders.&nbsp; Balder deserted his throne in the orb of
day,&mdash;and the mad and governless globe flew up into Asgard,
and burst its destructive flames upon the rebels.&nbsp; Thor, the
first-born of Odin, threw bye his star-formed diadem, girded his
brow with the thunder, and, wielding the red bolt of vengeance,
rushed upon them.&nbsp; The sightless horror rose in his terrible
strength, and the arrows of Vile, unerring as the lance of Hela,
flew among the foes; all was confusion, terror, and
despair&mdash;cries of anguish polluted the happy city&mdash;till
Odin recalled his warriors, and plunged their enemies in the
burning lake, bidding the proud Lok and the ambitious Surter
obtain their wish and seat themselves on thrones.</p>
<p>But though the power of the infernal spirits was thus curbed,
it was not destroyed; and, still invincible in malice, they
resolved to wound Odin through his favourite, man.&nbsp; Lok gave
birth to the snaky sin, whose folds encircle the earth, and bade
him breathe from his poisonous jaws upon <a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>her surface
the blast of contention and hate: he obeyed; and man, no longer
beneficent and kind, rose up against his brother; with bitter
words, he poured curses on the father who called him into life,
and smote on the bosom that had nourished him in
helplessness.&nbsp; The father of evil beheld and
smiled&mdash;his work was half accomplished&mdash;and he called
into existence death, to finish the deeds begun: the pale shadow
stalked over the earth and drank the crimson blood till she grew
wanton in her mirth, and besought her father for a companion: he
heard, and sent Fenris up to follow her steps, and exult in her
multiplied victims.&nbsp; The fiends in hell heard the sounds of
their triumph, and shouted responsive, when the shivering spirits
of the slain were hurled weeping into Niftheim.&nbsp; At length
their cruel joy was heard in Asgard, at the same moment that
sounds of sorrow ascended from the earth, from the few who still
remembered his name.&nbsp; It was from Scythia the plaining voice
arose, and the monarch, looking down from his throne, beheld the
last remnant of his people sinking beneath the power of the
Roman.&nbsp; Now then he determined to descend to the earth, not
only to lead them to conquest, but to teach them wisdom and
virtue.&nbsp; Frea, the mother of the gods, resolved to partake
<a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>the
toils of her husband; and Thor, the eldest born of Odin, the
ruler of the air, forsook his palace of nine hundred and forty
halls, laid by his terrific thunderbolt, and his diadem of twelve
stars, and, debasing his giant frame to the standard of humanity,
descended with his father to the earth.&nbsp; Cased in the armour
of Scythians, they joined the troops of that beloved people, and
the father god bidding them contend no longer against the power
of the Roman, to whom Odin had given their country, promised to
lead them to other fields, and give them other lands for their
inheritance.&nbsp; The fierce Scythians yielded to the persuasive
voice of him whom they only knew as the warrior Sigge, and,
rather than submit to the slavery they abhorred, they forsook the
tombs of their fathers, and sought an empire in the north.</p>
<p>In vain the inhabitants of these regions sought to oppose the
establishment of the heaven-conducted Scythians; in every battle
they were defeated and driven with loss from their cities: the
arrows of Frea carried destruction to the enemy&mdash;the mallet
of Thor crushed thousands&mdash;and Odin, raging through their
ranks, now as a warrior, now as a ferocious lion, spread
devastation through their armies, and drove them <a
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>from the
field.&nbsp; The Scythians saw these wonders; and secretly
acknowledged Valhalla&rsquo;s lord beneath the form of
Sigge.&nbsp; When the rage of battle was past, he lulled the
wounded to repose, and arrested the parting spirits of the dying
with the celestial strains of his harp; the wounds of his people
were cured, and their strength restored by his celestial power,
while, from the same cause, his enemies were bereft of courage
and of vigour.&nbsp; Sweden and Norway yielded to the matchless
warrior, and received with joy the unknown Sigge for their king,
but the Danes refused to acknowledge the leader of armies; and
Mimer, their prince, an enchanter, and the friend of Lok, opposed
himself against the victorious prince of Scythia.&nbsp; Before
the assembled Danes he contended with the stranger in eloquence
and poetry, and in these his own people were compelled, by the
severe laws of truth, to yield the palm to his rival.&nbsp; Mimer
was wise, eloquent, and brave; the strains of his harp were only
inferior to those of Sigge, and he felt deeply the injury which
he had sustained by the decision against him.&nbsp; Determined to
recover, with his sword, the glory he had lost, he called his
armies together, and bade defiance to the Scythians: the opposing
bands drew near; furious was the contest, for now, like <a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>a tiger
sprung Mimer on his foes&mdash;now as a fiery serpent stung their
hearts, or crushed them in his mighty folds.&nbsp; As terrible
raged Odin in various forms, carrying dismay around him, and
thinning the ranks of the valiant Danes.&nbsp; At length the
monarchs met&mdash;in human form stood Mimer&mdash;in human form,
prepared to oppose him, stood Valhalla&rsquo;s mighty king: but
momentary was the contest, the terrible blow of the Scythian
brought the head of the Dane to his feet, as its faltering tongue
pronounced the name of Odin.&nbsp; The foe fled to the camp,
while the father of men again raised to life his beloved
Scythians who had fallen in this, the greatest of his
fields.&nbsp; At length, wishing to give peace to the weary land,
he summoned the Danish chiefs to meet him in conference.&nbsp;
Seated on a throne, he received the warriors: in one hand he held
the sceptre of his power, the other rested on a golden dish, in
which, now richly embalmed, and adorned with a crown of gold, lay
the head of the wretched Mimer.&nbsp; The chiefs gazed in
silence&mdash;a silence unbroken by human sounds, but disturbed
by the voice of the dead, for the ghastly head opened its closed
lips, fixed its eyes, and bade, in hollow but authoritative
tones, its countrymen no longer oppose the will of the gods, but
receive for their <a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>prince and lawgiver him who was master of the
world!&nbsp; Again it sunk into silence, and the astonished
Danes, obeying its dictates, fell at the feet of the conqueror of
Mimer.&nbsp; And now, seated in peace on the thrones of the
north, more brightly shone the unmatched virtues of Sigge.&nbsp;
He taught his subjects husbandry&mdash;he taught them to plough
the waters&mdash;he opened to them the riches of
commerce&mdash;and he dug from the earth the treasures which ages
had concealed in her bosom;&mdash;he punished vice with
severity&mdash;he rewarded virtue with munificence&mdash;he
taught them letters&mdash;instructed them in the mysteries of the
Runic&mdash;and obliged them to cultivate the milder graces of
music and verse;&mdash;he allured men to obey by the charms of
his eloquence and the splendour of his glory; and he spoke to
their reason by his divine Hovamaal, which he gave them as his
best gift&mdash;his richest legacy.&nbsp; In this he bade them do
no wrong to each other&mdash;to honour the eternal gods&mdash;and
to render up life at the command of their country.&nbsp; When he
beheld the good effect of his regulations, and saw his people
firmly attached to his laws, he called around him his children,
born of his mortal wives, of the daughters of Scythia, and,
dividing his dominions among them, taught them to govern <a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>according
to his ordinances and example.&nbsp; Satisfied with his work, he
called Frea and Thor to his side, and, blessing once more his
mortal children, ascended with them into the regions of
light.&nbsp; Then loudly the Danes acknowledged Odin, and paid
their homage to his glory; to his race they have ever been
faithful, for they still fill the earthly thrones of their
father, who, from his abode in Asgard, looks down upon his
children, and crowns their lives with prosperity: and thus shall
he do till the long night which is to witness the last battle of
the gods&mdash;the last attack of Lok and his allies, and which
for ages they have been preparing&mdash;against Odin and the
happy spirits of Asgard.&nbsp; In the dreadful conflict, men and
demons, oceans, earths, Niftheim, nay, even Asgard itself, shall
be involved in one general wreck&mdash;one entire and
undistinguished ruin; the infernal spirits shall fall in the
convulsions&mdash;evil shall be no more&mdash;and from the ashes
of the universe shall arise a brighter heaven&mdash;a gloomier
hell, than those which have passed away.&nbsp; To the glorious
seats of Gimle, the city of burnished gold&mdash;to its
diamond-studded palaces and star-paved courts&mdash;shall the
spirits of the just ascend, with Odin and his triumphant sons, to
the enjoyment of one endless festival; while the cowards <a
name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>and wicked
of the earth shall sink with their infernal allies&mdash;the
revolted of heaven&mdash;into the caves of Nastronde, an abode
more horrible than Niftheim&mdash;a den built up of the carcasses
of snakes, and illuminated by devouring flames, where
ever-enduring sorrow shall be the punishment of the lost, from
which they shall have no power to escape, again to disturb the
repose of the just.</p>
<p>Honour and praise to Frea&mdash;victory to Thor&mdash;glory to
Odin, the greatest, and the best&mdash;hail to the master of gods
and men!</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Happily for his hearers, it was here, at length, that the
merciless Brandomann terminated his long-winded history.&nbsp;
Sleipner had for some time been his only auditor&mdash;Ildegarda
had been nodding repeatedly&mdash;Heidruna fidgetily trotting
backwards and forwards to the portal, watching the
clouds&mdash;Serimnor had given two or three most portentous
yawns&mdash;while the two ravens who did every thing in concert,
had tucked their heads under their wings, and gone fairly to
sleep:&mdash;but they all started up when the hum of his voice
had ceased, and thanked the good Brandomann as sincerely as if
they had <a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
341</span>been excessively delighted, for they were grateful that
he had finished at last, and were besides too well bred not to be
charmed with what had been done entirely for their amusement.</p>
<p>On the following day, during their usual rambles about the
island, the princess looked so unusually depressed, and said so
little in reply to the observations of her companion, that his
attention, ever on the watch, was aroused by her sadness;
tenderly he inquired the cause.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell
you,&rdquo; replied Ildegarda: &ldquo;when absent from you, and
believing your life in danger, my only anxiety was to return;
now, when that difficulty has passed away, I confess I am
wretched respecting my father&rsquo;s feelings and conduct, when
he shall discover that I have quitted him for ever; neither is my
own heart without a pang when I reflect that I shall see him no
more.&nbsp; Oh that I knew what is to come!&mdash;that I could
look into the future, and behold my destiny and his!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know not that it is in my power altogether to fulfil
your wishes,&rdquo; answered Brandomann; &ldquo;but I can give
you a glance into the future, so as to discover its general
complexion, but not to enable you to read exactly the very page
of destiny.&nbsp; That which I can, to gratify your curiosity, I
will do,&mdash;I will arrest for a few minutes the flight of <a
name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>the triune
deity Time, and, by her appearance, we shall be able to judge of
what is to come.&mdash;Urda, Werandi, Skulda!&rdquo; continued
Brandomann, raising his powerful voice to its utmost pitch,
&ldquo;obey the command of the lord of the Maelstrom, the mighty
delegate of Odin&mdash;pause in your flight for a moment, and
stand visibly before him!&rdquo;&nbsp; Scarcely was the
peremptory order uttered, ere a light cloud was seen advancing
towards them from the sea, and when it became stationary
Ildegarda beheld a female form slowly and gracefully emerging
from its centre; her features were indistinctly visible, and upon
the floating misty robe that enveloped her figure, many changing
objects were, some faintly, some powerfully, represented.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is Urda the Past,&rdquo; said Brandomann to Ildegarda;
&ldquo;the events written upon her breast and brow are partially
concealed by her garment of oblivion and doubt; and when this is
penetrated by mortal sight, they are still seen through the mists
of passion and prejudice, by which she is ever surrounded: look
now upon her breast and brow&mdash;what objects do they represent
to you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I see a criminal,&rdquo; said the
princess, &ldquo;about to suffer the sentence of
justice&mdash;the executioner is preparing to
strike.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To my view the representation is
different,&rdquo; <a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
343</span>replied Brandomann; &ldquo;I see a crowned king falling
beneath the murderous swords of his rebellious
subjects.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I observe a dying parent,&rdquo;
continued Ildegarda, &ldquo;who consigns his child to a noble
warrior who weeps by his couch, but presses the babe to his
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I also see the dying father,&rdquo;
said Brandomann, &ldquo;but he resigns his infant to a demon in
form, and worse than a demon in heart, for he instantly plunges a
dagger in its throat: what else do you remark?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Many other objects,&rdquo; continued the princess,
&ldquo;but nothing clearly; the goddess herself is retiring
slowly from my gaze, and to whom does she give
place?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To Werandi the Present,&rdquo;
answered Brandomann, &ldquo;in her snow-white robe, with her
unveiled face and open brow and eye&mdash;how clear she looks
upon us!&mdash;and her garments will shew us our actions of this
moment:&mdash;but she retires, and Skulda the Future supplies her
place; clad in a robe of darkness, she exhibits nothing to our
eyes, and the veil which covers her person conceals also her face
from our observation: she shall withdraw it, and her smile or
frown will shadow forth your destiny.&rdquo;&nbsp; The goddess
gently withdrew her veil, and the soft enchanting smile which she
beamed upon the princess banished anxiety from her bosom, and
graced the departure <a name="page344"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 344</span>of the triune spirit with the sweet
attribute of benevolence.</p>
<p>A few days after the prophetic smile of the deity of Time had
given such hope to the heart of Ildegarda, they were, while
wandering about the gardens of the palace, astonished by the
roaring of thunders which announced a distant storm: they were
surprised by the sudden change from daylight to darkness, and
were puzzling each other respecting its cause, when the storm
died rapidly away, the clouds fell down in a gentle shower, and
the rainbow-bridge stood out in faint splendour from the
heavens.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look, dearest,&rdquo; said Brandomann;
&ldquo;the spirit of the bow has lowered his beautiful
bridge&mdash;some of the lesser warriors are ascending to
Valhalla&mdash;I will address the guardian of it, and bid him
render the road and its passengers visible to your
sight.&mdash;All hail Heimdaller of the coloured crown!&rdquo;
continued Brandomann, &ldquo;the friend of Odin speaks to thee;
beautiful spirit of the rushing wings and eyes of tender glory,
let us look upon thy face, and the road which leads to thy
dwelling!&rdquo;&nbsp; The silvery voice of the spirit answered
him, giving an immediate assent to his desire, and in a moment
the road and its travellers became visible to Ildegarda.&nbsp;
Slowly, and with feeble steps, the wounded <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>warriors
dragged themselves on till they reached the summit of the bridge,
when the gates of light flew open, and the spirit, in giving them
his hand, bestowed upon them strength and beauty, and thus
prepared them for the presence of Odin and the glories of the
halls of Valhalla.</p>
<p>While Ildegarda with intense interest was watching the solemn
procession of the dead, her eyes were suddenly dazzled by a
brilliant light thrown upon the bridge, which now shone out in
tenfold splendour, colouring the mountains of the island with
tints of its beautiful hues.&nbsp; She looked up, and beheld the
spirit of the bow descending, glorious in his youthful beauty;
his diadem of many-coloured gems was on his lofty brow, and, in
the ineffable loveliness of his sunny smile, there was a
sweetness that made Ildegarda weep.&nbsp; &ldquo;He goes to
welcome one of the greatest of mortal heroes,&rdquo; said
Brandomann&mdash;&ldquo;one of the favourites of Odin; his
presence throws this glory round him, and at this moment the
beings of earth, who gaze upon the bridge, behold its colours at
the brightest: but see&mdash;at the foot of the arch there is one
ascending to meet the spirit!&mdash;his wounds are
terrible&mdash;his bosom is fearfully gored&mdash;and his steps
are feeble and slow&mdash;but he has the brow and the port of a
hero; as yet I <a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>know him not.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But <i>I</i>
do!&rdquo; shrieked the hapless Ildegarda&mdash;&ldquo;O
Brandomann, I know him well!&rdquo;&nbsp; The lord of the
Maelstrom looked up again, and painfully recognised the
shadow&mdash;it was indeed her father;&mdash;the pale inhabitant
of another world, whom she saw ascending slowly to meet the
welcome smile of the angel of light, was once the noble Haquin,
the last friend of Harold and his sons.&nbsp; Brandomann gazed in
grief and terror, and the sorrow he felt for the death of the
warrior was scarcely mitigated by the change wrought in his
wearied frame by the touch of the radiant Heimdaller.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ildegarda!&rdquo; he cried in a voice of tenderness and
pity; &ldquo;Ildegarda, think not that thou art alone in the
world, or that all that loved thee have left it; look up, my dear
one!&mdash;look on the happiness of thy noble father, and cease
to regret his fate; what could thy love offer him in exchange for
this?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ildegarda mournfully assented as she saw his
glory, and her grief became more resigned and gentle.&nbsp; She
returned to the palace with Brandomann, who, far from attempting
to console, wept with her the loss she had sustained.&nbsp; In
the evening her friends did not as usual visit the island, but
they explained the cause of their absence on the next.&nbsp; It
was in honour of Haquin they had been <a name="page347"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 347</span>detained at Valhalla, as Odin had
commanded the feast earlier, in order to compliment this noble
warrior,&mdash;&ldquo;who now,&rdquo; continued Sleipner,
&ldquo;sits highest in the hall, and nearest to Odin&rsquo;s
self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time reconciled the princess to her father&rsquo;s death, and
to her hopeless imprisonment in Moskoe.&nbsp; The generous
Brandomann, now that she had lost in the world all that was dear
to her, and was most entirely in his power, never spoke to her of
the love which it was but too plain he bore her.&nbsp; She saw
and rewarded his virtue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brandomann!&rdquo; she said
to him one day as they wandered through the gardens of the
desolate isle; &ldquo;Brandomann, friend of my heart, in the
world, where my father walks no longer, I have no interest, and
can never wish to return; yet I feel that I could love and render
some deserving being more happy than a lonely destiny could make
him; thou alone art worthy of this heart, and of the duty which I
will pay thee; I cannot love thee as I once loved
Haldane&mdash;as I fear I should love him still&mdash;that
feeling it is not in thy power to inspire; but I honour thy
virtue, and am grateful for its exercise.&nbsp; Wilt thou accept
this hand&mdash;this heart?&nbsp; If so, take me, Brandomann, for
I am thine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw herself, as she spoke, into the arms <a
name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>which
opened transportedly to receive her, and bowed her head upon his
breast.&nbsp; She could not distinguish his reply, for a sudden
peal of thunder rolled above their heads, and the earth was
shaken to its foundation&mdash;a frightful darkness covered the
island, and shrieks and howlings rung in their ears, mingled with
shouts of triumph and the cheering blasts of the trumpet.&nbsp;
Ildegarda clung closer to her lover for protection, when a
gentle, well-known voice reassured her spirits and relieved her
terrors.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look on me, my beloved,&rdquo; it said;
&ldquo;look on me, and receive the reward of thy virtue, and the
approbation of Heaven on thy choice.&rdquo;&nbsp; The princess
raised her eyes to the face of her lover, and beheld&mdash;not
Brandomann, but Haldane&mdash;the one, the only beloved, the
first choice of her innocent heart; it was on his bosom she
leaned&mdash;it was his arm that supported her slender form: she
trembled with painful emotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
Brandomann?&rdquo; she demanded&mdash;&ldquo;Is at thy feet, my
beloved,&rdquo; replied the graceful warrior: &ldquo;beneath that
hideous form, Lok, in revenge for an ancient scorn, had condemned
me to wear out my life, unless I could inspire a royal virgin
with sufficient love to become my wife.&nbsp; Odin, in compassion
to my sufferings, confined me to this island, and endowed me with
sufficient power to <a name="page349"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 349</span>fulfil the condition, and deceive
and baffle the evil spirits themselves, by the means of their
wretched agent, the detestable Frotho.&nbsp; Around thee stand
the gallant chiefs and the Norwegian captives, who were sent
against the monster of the Maelstrom, and who seemed to be
destroyed by my vengeance; they are now my friends, and wait to
conduct us to Denmark, where Haldane will lay his crown at thy
feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chiefs paid their homage to the princess,
and immediately after, there arrived, to offer their sincere
congratulations, her tender friends of many moons, the
eight-legged, four-legged, and two-legged animals of
Valhalla.&nbsp; Ildegarda, even on the bosom of Haldane, wept at
the parting; for she knew she should behold them no more.&nbsp;
They attended her to the shore, and beheld her embark in the
gallant ship which Niord, at the command of Odin, had preserved
for them in one of the ocean caves.&nbsp; Soon they were wafted
to Denmark, and Haldane burst upon the usurper so suddenly, that
he had no time even to arm his household guards for his
defence.&nbsp; He was presiding at a festival when Haldane
entered his presence; some of his nobles humbly acknowledged
their prince, and the others, not caring to attack him, made the
<a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>best of
their way out of the palace, leaving the miserable Frotho in the
power of his nephew, who, without giving him time to make his
will, threw him headlong into the cistern of mead before which he
was sitting.</p>
<p>Whether Haldane, in his natural shape, was as amiable and
complaisant as he had been under his assumed one, is a question
which the historian of his life cannot answer&mdash;nor whether
Ildegarda, on her throne in Denmark, found as true friends and
faithful servants as she had in the gulf of the Maelstrom:
certain it is, she lived to a great age with her glorious
husband, (who was the greatest prince of the race of Dan that
ever swayed the sceptre of the north,) and that once or twice
during their lives they had together visited the desolate isle;
and the princess, to the great scandal of the ladies and
gentlemen of the court, and surprise of her husband, wept
bitterly on finding that the marble palace and its beautiful
gardens had disappeared, the Moskoe isle had resumed its ancient
appearance, and nothing remained to mark it out as the scene of
such wonders as had passed in it.&nbsp; It has much the same
character at this hour; and it would be very difficult to
persuade its inhabitants, or the <a name="page351"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 351</span>stranger who may visit its shores,
that it once was a paradise only second to the bowers of
Valasciolf&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; You, gentle reader, know better;
and, complimenting you on the patience by which you have acquired
this knowledge, I bid you, for the present, farewell.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">TO THE</span><br />
LORD OF THE MAELSTROM.</h2>
<h3>PART I.</h3>
<p><i>Olave the Second</i>&mdash;one of the early kings of
Denmark, of the race of Dan.&nbsp; These princes believed
themselves descended from Odin.&nbsp; Olave was a worthless,
profligate prince, who left two sons, who succeeded him; the
elder, Frotho the Fifth, murdered his brother Harold, and
afterwards the assassin who, by his own order, had stabbed
him.&nbsp; He endeavoured to secure the persons of the princes
his nephews; but a nobleman, friend to their father, conveyed
them out of his reach, and concealed them in a cave till they
were of an age to revenge these injuries.</p>
<p><i>Asgard</i>&mdash;the country of the gods; the Olympus of
the north.</p>
<p><i>Valasciolf</i>&mdash;its chief city, in which the principal
divinities and more illustrious dead resided in magnificent
palaces.</p>
<p><a name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
353</span><i>Valhalla</i>&mdash;the chief palace of Valasciolf,
the regal residence of Odin.</p>
<p><i>Niftheim</i>&mdash;Hell.&nbsp; A territory of devouring
flames, typifying eternal remorse; the abode of the evil
principle and his attendant spirits.</p>
<p><i>Feggo</i>&mdash;the brother of Harwendil, king of Jutland,
and uncle to Hamlet.&nbsp; The latter prince feigned madness
after the murder of his father, but killed Feggo at a
festival.&nbsp; He succeeded to the crown, which he wore with
honour, till killed in battle by Viglet, king of Denmark.</p>
<p><i>Lok</i>&mdash;the evil principle.&nbsp; He gave birth to
Midgard (sin), the snake whose folds encircle the
earth&mdash;Hela (death)&mdash;and the wolf Fenris, the guardian
of the gate of hell; these were the evil progeny of Lok, begotten
for the destruction of the human race.</p>
<p><i>Surter</i>&mdash;the evil divinity of fire&mdash;the next
in rank to Lok.&nbsp; The Scythians represented him as a
beautiful youth; the Saxons as an old man, to whose honour they
dedicated the seventh day of the week.</p>
<p><i>Balder</i>&mdash;son of Odin, god of eloquence and poetry,
and ruler of the sun&mdash;the Scandinavian Apollo.&nbsp; He was
represented as a youth with a burning wheel upon his breast; his
face resembled the sun.</p>
<p><i>Nastronde</i>&mdash;According to the Scandinavian
mythology, at the end of the world, during a night which was to
last a year, a tremendous battle was to be fought between the
good and evil spirits, in which the former were to conquer and
reign in Gimle, a more glorious heaven than Asgard; while the
wicked were to be banished to Nastronde, a new hell, made
purposely for them.</p>
<h3><a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 354</span>PART
II.</h3>
<p><i>Maelstrom</i>, <i>Malestrom</i>, or
<i>Moskoestrom</i>&mdash;a tremendous whirlpool on the Norwegian
coast, very dangerous, and often fatal to navigators venturing
too near it.&nbsp; Moskoe is an island situated in the gulf:
there are also several others.</p>
<p><i>Sleipner</i>&mdash;the warrior horse of Odin.&nbsp; He had
four black legs and four white ones: he generally travelled
through the air.</p>
<p><i>Rinda</i>&mdash;daughter of Balder, and mother of Vile, by
Odin.&nbsp; The favourite goddess of the Scandinavian women.</p>
<p><i>Hydrasil</i>&mdash;the tree of heaven, standing in the
garden of Odin.&nbsp; It was the abode of the disposer of
man&rsquo;s destiny.</p>
<h3>PART III.</h3>
<p><i>Heidruna</i>&mdash;the immortal goat, whose milk was the
hydromel served up nightly at the festivals of Valhalla.</p>
<p><i>Serimnor</i>&mdash;the wild boar, whose flesh served them
for food.</p>
<p><i>Hugo</i> and <i>Mumin</i>&mdash;the raven messengers of
Odin.</p>
<p><i>Thor</i>&mdash;the warrior god&mdash;the eldest son of
Odin, who, in his journey over the world, defeated Midgard, and
loosened his folds from the earth; he is typical of divine
justice and vengeance.&nbsp; In the beautiful fables of the
Scalds, he is represented as a stern warrior, armed with an
enormous mallet, and wearing a crown of twelve stars.&nbsp; He
lived in a palace of Valasciolf, of five hundred and forty halls,
and was the ruler and wielder of the thunderbolt.</p>
<p><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span><i>Forsete</i>&mdash;divinity of controversy.&nbsp; I
believe this deity is peculiar to the Scandinavians.&nbsp; He
lived in a palace called Glitner.</p>
<p><i>Blind horror</i>&mdash;Hoder&mdash;whose name was never
pronounced by the Scythians without fear and immediate
expiation&mdash;son of Odin, and born blind&mdash;the deity of
strength.&nbsp; He was abhorred in heaven, because, from envy, he
attacked Balder, threw him from his throne, and put out the
sun.&nbsp; Odin interfered, and punished Hoder by the arrows of
Vile (lightning), and afterwards restored the sun.&nbsp; It was
thus, in their beautiful and fanciful mythology, like the Greeks,
and I think no less elegantly, that the Scalds described natural,
but not understood events.&nbsp; This story describes an eclipse
of the sun, the strong and blind Hoder signifying darkness.</p>
<p><i>Lofna</i>&mdash;goddess of reconciliation.&nbsp; I believe
this deity is also peculiar to the Scythians; they have deified
her with great propriety.&nbsp; Her post could not have been a
sinecure in a paradise where happiness consisted in drinking and
fighting.</p>
<p><i>Hiarn</i>&mdash;his story is strictly historical.&nbsp; It
was Eric the Third who was so maddened by music as to commit
murder for no other cause.</p>
<p><i>Geysers</i>&mdash;boiling spouting springs in Iceland: they
are near to Skalholt and Hecla; they spout water to a tremendous
and incredible height.</p>
<p><i>Dofrefeld</i>&mdash;a mighty range of Norwegian mountains,
intersected by rivers and cataracts.</p>
<p><i>Dolsteen</i>&mdash;a wonderful cavern beneath the Dofrefeld
mountains.</p>
<p><i>Niord</i>&mdash;the Scandinavian Neptune.</p>
<h3><a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>PART
IV.</h3>
<p><i>Uffon</i>&mdash;this story is also historical.&nbsp;
Shakspeare, who read Danish history, borrowed the circumstance of
Vermund&rsquo;s death for that of Gloster in King Lear.</p>
<p><i>Lidscialf</i>&mdash;the throne of Odin.</p>
<p><i>Heimdaller</i>&mdash;guardian of the bridge Bifrost, or the
rainbow, by which the happy dead ascended into Asgard.&nbsp; He
received the souls who were selected by the Valkyries, and
conducted them to Odin.</p>
<p><i>Vile</i>&mdash;god of archery; son of Odin and Rinda.</p>
<h3>PART V.</h3>
<p><i>Brage</i>&mdash;god of music and song.</p>
<p><i>Hovamaal</i>&mdash;bible of Odin.</p>
<p><i>Odin</i>&mdash;a wise and virtuous warrior, whose
beneficence procured him, among the early Scythians,
deification.&nbsp; As a divinity, the father of gods and men, he
is the husband of Frea (the earth), and from the union of divine
love and the earth, spring light, heat, the elements, the
seasons, strength, and genius, typified by Balder, Thor, Frey,
Hoder, and Balder again, as orator and poet.&nbsp; Odin, mounted
upon his horse Sleipner, represents active benevolence.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
